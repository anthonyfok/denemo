This branch adds support for a denemo-specific load path. The embeded guile's load path 
gets extendend with (data-dir)/modules (i.e. /usr/local/share/denemo/modules).

As a second, related, feature it's now possible to extend denemos guile-loadpath from the
environment. Starting denemo like: 

 DENEMO_LOAD_PATH /home/user/denemo-guile/:/tmp/scratch/ denemo 

will prepend the given directories to guile's loadpath so it's possible to shaddow/patch guile or
denemos build-in modules.
