<a class="toc" name="toc-Part-I">Part I.</a> Getting Started
</h1>
<h1 class="Section-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section--1"></a>Introduction 
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo lets you create musical scores. You can type music in using the keyboard or play it in using a MIDI contoller or the microphone input. You can edit your music - the input display window shows you what you are working on in music notation - and you can playback to check how it sounds. The Print View window shows the final printed score, typeset to the highest standards used in the music publishing industry - thanks to the Lilypond music typesetting program.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of music notation programs. It also means you are less likely to input a slur when you mean a tie, or a whole note rest when you mean a whole measure rest, for example - these often look similar in the typeset and are easily confused, but Denemo’s input display makes clear the distinction. Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positioning of some notation is possible on the final typeset display.
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1">1</a> Input Methods
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Most people will start with playing around with Denemo using the mouse, but by the time you are reading this you will want something more efficient. Try using the pc keyboard. By default, keys <tt>a-g</tt> represent the note names and <tt>0-6</tt> the different durations (whole note, half note etc). When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key <tt>0</tt> will insert a whole note at the cursor. Pressing the <tt>a</tt> key will append the nearest A. If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note name, it will use the last entered duration. There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen or flatten. Use +/- with the shift key to sharpen or flatten an existing note. Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration of a note. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key or mouse) the cursor turns green and then <tt>a</tt>-<tt>g</tt> edits the note name. To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike <tt>A</tt>,<tt>A-G</tt>,<tt>G</tt>. When the cursor is green the keys<tt> 0-6</tt> change the duration of the note, while Shift-<tt>0-6</tt> insert a note before the cursor. (If you use the numeric keypad you can use <tt>Shift-KP 0-6</tt> for this). The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while <tt>Alt-a-g</tt> add notes to the chord at the cursor. <tt>Ins</tt> inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue) a note, a double <tt>Del</tt>, <tt>Del</tt> removes it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle on a note-position. Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing the measure. Red indicates that the measure is already full. When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor or insert before it. The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
For a more detailed description of Denemo’s various input methods, see <a class="Reference" href="#sec:A-Survey-of-Input-Methods">A Survey of the Input Methods↓</a>. You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system - e.g. under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot with the shortcut Control-period shown in blue next to the command. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu. There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam, Da Capo, cresc. etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere. When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help-&gt;Turn Excessive Tooltips (Off/On), and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing via Edit-&gt;Change Preferences.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And once you have stopped playing around with the mouse for entering notes you can hide the palettes at the side to give more room for the music display (right click and Edit Palette).
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are a few of the keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Letters <tt>a-g</tt> edit the note at the cursor to be A-G, if the cursor is in the appending position then notes are added. Letters <tt>A-G</tt> (either <tt>CapsLock</tt> or <tt>Shift</tt>) insert a note at the cursor. 
</li>
<li>
Numbers <tt>0-6</tt> are used to refer to the note durations Whole Note ... 64th Note. They insert a duration at the cursor, which you then give a pitch to with a note name. With the shift key held (or the CapsLock on) <tt>0-6</tt> edits the duration of the note at the cursor. The corresponding Numeric Keypad keys can be used instead.
</li>
<li>
The period (<tt>.</tt>) dots a note, <tt>Ctrl-.</tt> removes a dot, on the numeric keypad Decimal (.) cycles through dotted, double-dotted, no-dot.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Alt-0-6</tt> inserts a rest.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Alt-a-g</tt> Add notes to a chord. Or position the cursor and use <tt>Insert</tt> to add a note, <tt>Ctrl-Insert</tt> to remove it. 
</li>
<li>
<tt>7</tt> starts a slur, <tt>8</tt> extends it, while <tt>9</tt> reduces it.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift-/</tt> inserts a cautionary accidental.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Esc</tt> switches between various views of the music which can allow more music on the screen at once.
</li>
<li>
<tt>TAB</tt> alternately inserts a start or stop triplet marker.
</li>
<li>
Multiply (<tt>*</tt> on the numeric keypad) ties/unties the note at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Divide (<tt>/</tt> on the numeric keypad) sets/usets the note at the cursor as a grace note.
</li>
<li>
Add/Subtract (<tt>+/-</tt> on the numeric keypad) sharpens/flattens the note at the cursor.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Two-key shortcuts are also available such as "<tt>B</tt>,<tt>s</tt>" for start repeat barline and "<tt>B</tt>,<tt>e</tt>" for end repeat barline. 
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Some Common Mouse Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are a few of the mouse shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo (keyboards may vary, for control, shift, alt etc modifiers). Note that under the Input menu is an option to turn on more mouse-friendly buttons, this is the default for Windows users.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Scroll Wheel pans up/down to bring staffs out of view into the window.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift</tt> Key and Scroll Wheel pans the score left/right.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Control</tt> Key and Scroll Wheel zooms.
</li>
<li>
Right-button click edits at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Double-click brings up the Object Inspector on the current object, from there you can launch the Object Editor.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift</tt>-right-button click edits things attached to the object at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Double click left-button describes the object clicked on.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl-Shift</tt> left-button drag allow you to move stuff in the display if it is cluttered. Typesettting is not affected.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl-Shift</tt> Key and Right mouse button gives the menu of directives to insert at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift</tt> Key and Left mouse button drags notes up and down.
</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.3">1.3</a> Some Common Uses of MIDI in
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions. Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names at the pc-keyboard). With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be used for this too). If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it is played on a different channel, so that you are alerted to possible pitch spelling errors (e.g. inputting A-sharp for B-flat). By holding down the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key a score can be checked by playing the notes - the cursor only advances if the correct note is played, and the <tt>Shift</tt> key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output (e.g. to check a phrase before playing it in). There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too. The Pitch Bend controller can be used to set the range of sharps and flats to be used, and the modulation controller can be used to mark sections of the music. With the MIDI controller set as Input source (Input menu) the duration keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown) - you can enter as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes on top.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.4">1.4</a> Note and Rest Entry Palettes
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
On starting Denemo for the very first time a series of palettes are placed near the main window with buttons to insert and change notes. For more serious use these just waste space, so by right clicking on them and choosing Edit this Palette they can be hidden.
</div>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Part-II">Part II.</a> Using Denemo
</h1>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> General Concepts
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single file (with .denemo suffix). This is represented on the screen by a "tab". If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tab.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (<tt>PgUp</tt>, <tt>PgDown</tt>), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu. A movement is a continuous piece of music with titles etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
When you have more than one movement numbered buttons appear in the score titles bar for you to navigate by. The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental is the movement number.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically) and within the staffs Denemo Objects. These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes and Denemo Directives (see <a class="Reference" href="#sec:Denemo-Directives">Denemo Directives↓</a>). The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully typeset). The Denemo Directives are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples. They can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a chord, to a staff as a whole and to the score as a whole; in this case the directive can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to. Each Denemo Directive carries its own display method. For example the Close Repeat barline appears as a Denemo Object in the input display, while a Directive attached to a staff (e.g. Instrument Name, or Smaller Staff Size) may appear in a menu under a tools icon to the right of the staff. In the case of "Smaller Staff" the directive directs the LilyPond typesetter to make the staff smaller, and it can be edited from the menu under the tools icon to the left of the clef. Another tools icon appears if directives are attached to voices within a staff, again to the left of the clef, below the staff one.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing - the clef is drawn pale and there is no timesignature for such extra voices so it is easy to understand what is going on. The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited. It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one and green when editing (i.e. on an already entered object).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular action, but also each menu item lets you add the command to a palette, enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts for the action. A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key while the menu item is selected. All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself. The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.g. working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.). When you place a command in a palette you can add to an existing palette or create a new one - you can choose or create any number of these, free-floating or docked in the main display. Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions - often by modifying ones that are already there - using the Scheme scripting window.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When a file is loaded it opens at the point where you left off editing it. The position and size of the window is restored as well as the position and size of the source pdf you are transcribing from.

The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and/or right hand side. Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu. At the bottom is a status line showing which movement you are in and what sort of object the cursor is on. If there are any MIDI filters that active they will be noted at the right in the status bar. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area. When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on. By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space for more of the music. If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still drag the red bar upwards to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance. You can hide staffs in the display if needed using the Staffs-&gt;Display Effects menu. If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu), and arrange a "page view" of the input music - useful when using playback.

The Denemo Display is normally set to display any extra voices on a separate staff so as to make it easy to work with - the voices have their clef displayed in yellow and do not show a key signature as these are supplied by the main staff (or &ldquo;primary voice&rdquo;). Voices will also normally be assigned to voice numbers 1,2,3,4 using the Initial Voice commands in this menu (this controls the stemming, slur positions etc). Voices can change their voice number during the music - the commands for this are in the Directives-&gt;Typesettter-&gt;Voices menu as they insert stem change objects in between the notes.

<div class="Unindented">
Music snippets are short selections from a voice which can be stored on the Snippet tool bar. They have two main uses: they can act as a repository of &ldquo;motifs&rdquo; which can be inserted (<tt>Ctrl-Space</tt>) at the cursor, and they can be used as an extension to the &ldquo;prevailing duration&rdquo; idea. In the second use, by selecting a snippet as you enter pitches the durations are assigned from the next step in the snippet. The first case is especially useful when entering a complex rhythm which is repeated many times in the piece. In all cases the snippet can contain all sorts of attributes and markings, slurs, beaming indications, ornaments etc, and these will then all be entered with a single keypress or as you add pitches.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.9.2">3.9.2</a> Details
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The Snippet tool bar has only one button initially: &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. This button lets you create a snippet from the current selection. The selection should be a contiguous selection of objects in a single voice. Once created the snippet appears on the snippet tool bar as a button - the label is generated to indicate the content, and this label can be further edited by clicking on the button and choosing &ldquo;Edit Label&rdquo;. Other options on clicking a snippet button are to insert the snippet, to select the snippet (in which case as you enter pitches they follow the rhythm of the snippet, including any slurs, trills, or articulations that are in the snippet) etc. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>Ctrl-Space </tt>inserts the selected snippet or (if none is selected) inserts the snippet that you specify by number. <tt>Shift-Space</tt> selects the next snippet (or first if none selected), to unselect a snippet choose a duration (0, 1...) to be used instead for entering pitches.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the insertion case, you may have two or three snippets that apply to a given score - special bits of text that appear over notes for example - and you can insert them using <tt>Ctrl-Space</tt>, 1 (or 2 or 3 ...) as needed.

Choose a large zoom factor before you begin, and turn on the control points (red dots and crosses) as described <a class="Reference" href="#sub:Mouse-Controls">Mouse Controls↑</a>above. Then right click on the curve and choose Edit Shape. You have to click on the reference point first - this is on the center-line of the staff at the horizontal position of the notehead where the curve starts - this is marked with a red dot.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo allows you to explore all the actions (insert/delete/edit/navigate...) using the menus. So, for example, inserting notes can be found under Notes/Rests while inserting a Staff comes under Staffs/Voices. When you have found the action you need hovering over the item will give an explanation of what it does. The keyboard or mouse shortcut to use for the command is in blue on the right. You can set the keyboard shortcut just by pressing the desired key while the menu item is selected. You can right click on the menu item to set a a two-key keyboard shortcut or mouse shortcut to activate the action. In addition you can customize the mouse actions to initiate commands, and set the cursor that will show while certain mouse conditions apply.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Using the menus for everything would be very slow, but next to each menu item is the keypress that you can use instead. If there is no keypress shown, and you want to use that item often, then right click on the menu item and you can set a key combination for that menu action. Right clicking is also useful for getting a description of what the menu action is. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you need you can consult the menu system to find out. This method is good for touch typists.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One way to do this is enter the music as pure rhythms, ignoring the note names. The durations show as yellow/brown notes. Each duration sounds its own pitch and length as you enter the durations. As you start each measure the bell will sound so that you can keep your eyes on the score you are copying without needing to look up and check that you haven’t miss-typed. If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you have entered the rhythms for one or two measures you play the notes via MIDI - they automatically fill in the rhythm for you. When you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you have notated. By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play it twice - once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches. If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals used to match the score. If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point, but this isn’t needed for MIDI in.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-9.2">9.2</a> Playing Notes into Denemo - MIDI
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo can take pitches directly from MIDI input. Select Input-&gt;Midi Input. The control panel allows you to choose the enharmonic range, the default centers around the initial key signature (e.g. E-flat to G-sharp for C-major). If you enter a diminished or augmented interval the note will be played in a separate MIDI channel which can be used to alert you to pitch-spelling mistakes (e.g. entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented and dimished intervals if you have the enharmonic range set wrongly for your piece). Under Input-&gt;MIDI are various "MIDI filters" that allow you to control how the MIDI input is used: with none active the behavior is as if you had entered the notes using the pc-keyboard, but with the following advantages 
</div>
<ul>
<li>
The octave, accidental and note name are all entered in one press of the MIDI key. The cursor automatically advances so you can continue to play in notes.
</li>
<li>
The duration keys enter the yellow/brown duration-only notes, when you play a MIDI key the cursor automatically moves to the first of these.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Alt</tt> key (or sustain pedal) lets you enter chords.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key lets you check the pitches of a piece already entered. The cursor only advances if the note played is the one at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Shift</tt> key lets you listen to the MIDI keyboard without affecting the score.
</li>
<li>
The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo’s simple pitch-spelling strategy. The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F - B-flat.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever you wish. One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the bass note. Another is the "AngryDelete" filter. With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI filters are found under Input -&gt; MIDI
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-9.3">9.3</a> Playing Notes into Denemo - Audio (Soundcard Mic Input)
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of the computer; it doesn’t attempt to guess the rhythm - such systems do not work well - but you will find that playing the notes in time will help you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience rather than a chore.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note. If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals at the computer keyboard. Using the headphones-out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off" interfering with the pitch detection. Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification - it is worth getting the level right before you begin.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When you select the Input-&gt;Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition window pops up. While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive to pitches heard via the microphone input. The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will be entered into the score. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are two ways of using the pitch entry - Overlay mode (default) and Insert mode. The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure in the prevailing rhythm - the mode is set to Insert for this. The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the pitches you sound. There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical instrument tuner.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor. If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected. You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them altogether if you want to start over in a measure. If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the cursor position.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when you enter the given pitch - you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic instrument.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you don’t have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone, in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument to get reliable detection. Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones. To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in – the notes should all turn blue if you have perfect detection. It is worth while getting perfect detection – more than one or two miss-detects per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay method.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes. You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting the rhythm. In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn’t involve entering the rhythm separately. For this select Input-&gt;Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up. With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm. The same applies if you have MIDI - by choosing a rhythm (e.g. half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-9.4.1">9.4.1</a> Note Entry
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Basic Note entry is to type a number key <tt>0-6</tt> for the duration of the note followed by a letter key <tt>a-g</tt> for the note name. (The shorter duration notes are available, but the keys <tt>7</tt>,<tt>8</tt>,<tt>9</tt> are used for starting and extending/reducing slurs). If the duration is the same as the last entered note then just the note name is needed. The duration can be dotted with the period key, and the octave adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).
</div>

When you append music by pressing a duration key with a MIDI controller active, you get a brown note, indicating a duration which has not been given a pitch. Once you have pressed a note-name it becomes that note printed in black. Prior to that it is a pure rhythm and will play back as a drum beat and will print as a space.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When not appending music, you need to use the <tt>shift</tt> key to insert a new note, or set the <tt>Caps Lock</tt>. So <tt>Shift-a</tt>,<tt>Shift-a</tt> inserts the note A etc. Plain <tt>a</tt> edits the note at the cursor to be an A. Likewise with the numeric keypad the <tt>Shift</tt> key can be used to edit a note duration, while the plain number keys insert the duration of the note at the cursor. (If you do not have a numeric keypad, you have to use the number keys - best to plug in an additional USB keyboard with numeric keypad, they are very cheap nowadays).

Spacer rests (that is non-printing rests as seen in keyboard polyphony) have shortcuts too <tt>Mod4-0</tt> etc, where <tt>Mod4</tt> is the key with a flag on it. However, on Windows machines you will need to reclaim the <tt>Windows</tt> Mod-4 key from Microsoft or re-define the shortcuts, e.g. to <tt>Shift-Alt-0</tt> etc.

If you have a PDF of music you wish to transcribe with Denemo you can display it within Denemo and create links between the source material and your transcrition. This means that when you later review your work you can quickly locate which point in the original manuscript belongs to which point in your transcription
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Select the File-&gt;Open menu and the item Open a Source for Transcribing. Select the PDF containing the music to be transcribed from. The PDF is opened in a Source View window. Right-click in this window at the point that your transcription will start. This will create a link - a Denemo Directive Object - in your score at the Denemo cursor position, shown as arrow icon. If you later use a right-click on this Denemo Directive the source file will be re-opened with the blue highlight marker on that point in the score. (Depending on the position of the top of the page you may need to scroll the Source View window up or down to bring it into view).

<div class="Unindented">
If you send the PDF output of your score to someone to proof-read they can make PDF annotations to it. In the File-&gt;Open menu choose Open Proof Read PDF to open a proof-read PDF. It will open at the first annotation, and, by clicking on the note the annotation applies to, the annotation is transferred as a comment into the score before the note chosen. When you have done all the annotations on the first page advance to the next page with annotations using the button "Next".
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are limitations - the PDF must be created from your score with point-and-click (the default) and you must not alter the score in a way that would invalidate the point-and-click. (Basically, don’t edit again until the proof-reading is done, always good practice!) Also, enter the annotations in order from the start and don’t edit before you have entered all the annotations, as this could invalidate the point-and-click.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-13.1">13.1</a> Adding and Editing Key/Mouse Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo allows you to choose which keys activate which commands (shortcuts). It also allows you to choose Mouse press/release gestures (in combination with keys such as <tt>Shift</tt>, <tt>NumLock</tt>, <tt>CapsLock</tt> etc).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
See <a class="Reference" href="#sub:The-Command-Center">The Command Center↑</a> for setting shortcuts. The following method can also be used. To choose a shortcut for a menu item, select the item (it becomes highlighted) and press the key that you want to become the shortcut. For mouse shortcuts, right-click the menu item and choose the Create Mouse Shortcut, to change the pointer shape during mouse operations invoke the Command Center with the Edit Shortcuts option. The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking on the big button. The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Mouse Shortcuts are tricky to set - you are able to control what happens on mouse button press and release, which can be used to do things like drag notes up and down. But they are tricky to set up!
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command, you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or steal the shortcut. Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say the <tt>NumLock</tt> down and those without or to ignore it. If the <tt>NumLock</tt> is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting of <tt>NumLock</tt> is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the <tt>NumLock</tt> was off.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist in bright blue lettering. PrsL-<tt>CapsLoc</tt>, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the <tt>CapsLock</tt> light is on. In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so that together with the RlsL-<tt>CapsLoc</tt> for the release of the left mouse button, you can "draw" slurs by using the mouse. Similarly, <tt>Shift</tt> with left mouse button (MveL-<tt>Shift</tt>) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff. (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor).

</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--4"></a>Adding More Features 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with. Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as to keep the menu sizes manageable. Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default setup. Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-1"></a>An example - quicker dynamics selection
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
It can be slow to choose dynamics (<tt>Ctrl-D</tt>) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse). You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available as for example: (define DenemoDynamicList ’(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127" "Piano"))) This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano available by pressing down arrow Return. (The others via More of course). If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then it will be defined when you start Denemo.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-13.2.1">13.2.1</a> Recording a Denemo Macro 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can also get Denemo to record a frequently used sequence of actions - it can be installed in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut just like any other command. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To do this choose View-&gt;Scheme Script. (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!). In the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set of steps you wish Denemo to record.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As a simple example, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?). You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if that is your shortcut). (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command entered into the Scheme window). Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window. To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit-&gt;Customize Commands...-&gt;Manage Command Set-&gt;Save as Default Command Set). If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you exit. Otherwise you can re-load via the More-&gt;My Commands menu item.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-13.2.2">13.2.2</a> Editing a LilyPond Tweak
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which is by modifying a tweak that has already been done. This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive (usually found under the Advanced button provided by an edit script). Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter. You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be positioned.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command, and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-13.2.3">13.2.3</a> Writing Scheme Scripts 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme Script window to create any command you want. Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt other scripts to do what you want.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive into the score. This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories in the same way as the menu system itself). Then choose Get Script from the right click menu. With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window. Here you can see the part that says
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="environment"><span class="arrayrow">

</span>
</span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
which is inserting the LilyPond directive "\mark \default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark. (The extra backslashes are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean a \ sign). You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need - always doubling the \ signs. The you can save as a new menu item, or use Save Script to customize the script you started with.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available. Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined.

<div class="Unindented">
Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument is passed to them from Scheme. In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value" is passed these will be used and no popup will occur. The field "name" will be given the value "value". The \0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings. As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass the value. The names of the fields depend on the action being called. So for example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<span class="arraycell align-l">

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo directives are things like special barlines, rehearsal marks that appear amongst the notes, as well things like trills that are attached to notes and modifications to other things in the score to give them a different appearance or behavior. If they are objects in their own right ("Standalone Directives"), like the first time bar marker then they appear betwen notes and the cursor can be placed on them. If they are attached to other things (such as a page break attached to a movement) then they are modified with the command used to create them.

Double clicking on Standalone Directives, gives information about the directive, while right-clicking will edit it.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-13.3">13.3</a> LilyPond Editing
</h2>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-4"></a>Introduction
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within Denemo. This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.g. multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo. The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which you can use.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable template or example file exists). Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep separate LilyPond files.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-13.3.1">13.3.1</a> Using the LilyPond Window
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with the LilyPond output in it. The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show the various sections or to create custom versions. The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo file.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between editing textually and editing in Denemo.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text. LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout). There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current Denemo object. Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo window cursor to move in synchronism.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond text in the window. This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them, or even make a temporary edit for just one print. If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered. So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-5"></a>Detail
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same music input. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group of staffs or even a piano reduction. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons. These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as "MvmntIVoiceIMusic" and so on. Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks) and the text inserted will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you are editing. (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just before the note name - one of the arrow keys will do).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score layout and selecting create custom score layout. The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI. If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print command prints, e.g. both a full score and parts. Using the \book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder .denemo in your home folder).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression \MvmntIVoiceIMusic. This means that the same music can be output in several different ways, so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {\MvmntIVoiceITimeSig \MvmntIVoiceIKeySig \MvmntIVoiceIClef} </tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>MvmntIVoiceIMusic = {\MvmntIVoiceIProlog \MvmntIVoiceI}</tt>
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Where \MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other definitions hold the time signature, clef etc. By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do if you never look at the LilyPond window. What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part. However, if you use the File-&gt;Print command then it prints the first custom scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do not have any custom scoreblocks).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Clicking (as opposed to using the arrow keys) in the LilyPond text does not move the cursor in the Denemo window. When you delete a LilyPond directive textually you have to move the cursor to start re-inserting it.

By saving a Denemo score with a script defined (in the script window) you can create music lessons, automatic midi player... the possibilities are endless. When you open such a score, the script is run - it can take user input and manipulate the score, or do other actions as your fancy takes you.

There is a special score init.denemo that is run on startup. By editing this you can startup with whatever template and whatever actions you wish to be performed. If you set it to do something that quits Denemo, you may need to delete the file before using Denemo normally again. Your local init.denemo is stored in the directory .denemo/actions in your home directory.To create it put the script you want in the script window and use SaveAs selecting ~/.denemo/actions/init.denemo as your file to save to.

<div class="Unindented">
Denemo Objects are all the things that are placed in the measures of the staffs in the Denemo Display. These are Chords, Notes (single note chords), Rests, Clef Changes, Key Changes, Time Signature Changes, Voice Changes (stemming control), Tuplet Starts, Tuplet Ends and Denemo Directives. The Denemo cursor can be stepped through every Denemo Object in the bar and by double clicking the object can be inspected and edited in detail.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-15">15</a> <a class="Label" name="sec:Denemo-Directives"> </a>Denemo Directives
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo Directives give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can be changed by the user.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score and can modify the behavior of the element concerned. They contain fields to describe how the element’s properties should be modified, either in the display or in the printing. Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows. This means Denemo can grow - you can add features - without getting a new version.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo. Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to them.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start of the score and just before each movement. The display field is shown at the top of the display.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
scoreheader: Attached to the score. The postfix field is put inside a \header{} block at the start of the score.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement. The prefix field is placed before the movements \score{} block, the postfix after it.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
header: Attached to a movement. As scoreheader but for \header[] blocks inside the movement’s score block.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
paper: Attached to the score. The postfix is placed inside a \paper{} block.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
layout: Attached to a movement. The postfix is placed inside a \layout{} block in the movement’s scoreblock.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures. (e.g. used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element - it comes with the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and the postfix after it.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the postfix after it. Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc. Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic) and tx, ty for the display text.
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set. For example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="environment"><span class="arrayrow">
<span class="arraycell align-l">
(d − DirectivePut − note − postfix"LHFinger""3")
</span>

</span>
</span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
will put the fingering 3 on (after) the note at the cursor.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
d-DirectiveGet-type-field type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. This function returns the value in the field or #f if there is no directive with the given tag at the cursor.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
d-DirectiveDelete-type type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note. This function returns #t or #f if a directive with the given tag was deleted.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15.1">15.1</a> The Directive Fields
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the LilyPond output.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
postfix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
prefix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
display - text to be shown in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
tx,ty - where to show the text in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
graphic - For directives that are in the music this is a .png image to be shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these). The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -&gt; Save Graphic command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required. For directives attached to the score, movement etc the string set here will be displayed on the button in the button box for that sort of directive (see Show Score Titles etc in view menu for showing this button box).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
gx,gy - where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
minpixels - how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
override - Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo display for the item. A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional information not explicit in the music notation (e.g. the tempo of an Adagio marking).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
midibytes - a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation is given by the MIDI bits in the override field
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The override field contains the following bits:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND: override the LilyPond output normally used at this point, rather than adding to the normal output. The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC: overrides what Denemo would normally show in the display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME: the MIDI velocity to use
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION: affects the duration of a note. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_REPEAT: indicates that an earlier passage should be repeated (from a directive of the same tag). not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL: midibytes field gives the MIDI channel to use (? implemented?)
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO: midibytes field gives the tempo to use.
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE: the value in midibytes is to be used just for the item the directive is attached to. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP: the value in midibytes is to be used from this point on
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP: the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting value, a corresponding directive (i.e. with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated between these. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE: value in midibytes is used relative to the current value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.g. an absolute velocity etc)
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_PERCENT: value in midibytes is interpreted as percentage value. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
These flags are combined together to get the combination required for the directive using the scheme procedure called logior.
</div>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15.2">15.2</a> Directive Edit Scripts
</h2>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-6"></a>Introduction
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic - a button then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive. Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below). Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it. What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name of the directive. For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMark" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname). This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly. The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirective EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="environment"><span class="arrayrow">
<span class="arraycell align-l">
(d − DirectiveTextEdit −

</span>

</span>
</span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Where &lt;tagname&gt; specifies the directive to be edited and &lt;field&gt; is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.
</div>
<div class="Indented">

</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Each menu can have an initialization script, which can contain procedures that would be too time consuming to define every time they are needed. These scripts are guaranteed to be run before any menu item is activated within the menu. They can be read/written using the right click menu on any scripted menu item.

<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-15.2.2">15.2.2</a> Edit Scripts
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Each directive has a tag field, so that it can be recognized by the scripts that manipulate it. In particular for each tag there can be an edit script, for editing a directive of that tag. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can read and write edit scripts by using the low level editing dialog on a directive with the tag you are writing for. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
The low level editing dialog is the one that is presented if there is no edit script. Edit scripts can themselves give access to this dialog by including an option cue-Advanced which calls (d-DirectiveTextEdit-field tag) for the appropriate field and tag. For an example see the edit script for Instruments -&gt; Orchestra -&gt; RehearsalMark.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup. The functions and variables for script editing are:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.
</li>
<li>
Extra-Offset tag type context. Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited, which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond context of the object. Only tag is required. Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
</li>
<li>
SetPadding tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li>
<li>
SetRelativeFontSize tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it shifts the font size of the following text in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li>
<li>
CreateButton tag label this is just a convenience function to put a button with the passed in label onto a button box at the top of the screen. Scripts can attach actions to such tagged buttons.
</li>
<li>
d-SetDirectiveTagActionScript tag scheme-actions. This command sets scheme-actions as the actions to be performed when the button of the given tag is clicked. The default action is to run any editscript associated with tag, and if none to run the d-DirectiveTextEdit-score on the directive that displays the button.
</li>
<li>
d-DirectiveGetForTag-field tag. Useful variables defined:<ul>
<li>
