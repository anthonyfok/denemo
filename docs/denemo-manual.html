</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo lets you create musical scores. You can type music in using the keyboard or play it in using a MIDI contoller or the microphone input. You can edit your music - the input display window shows you what you are working on in music notation - and you can playback to check how it sounds. The Print View window shows the final printed score, typeset to the highest standards used in the music publishing industry - thanks to the Lilypond music typesetting program.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of music notation programs. It also means you are less likely to input a slur when you mean a tie, or a whole note rest when you mean a whole measure rest, for example - these often look similar in the typeset and are easily confused, but Denemo’s input display makes clear the distinction. Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positioning of some notation is possible on the final typeset display.
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-1">1</a> Input Methods
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Most people will start with playing around with Denemo using the mouse, but by the time you are reading this you will want something more efficient. Try using the pc keyboard. By default, keys <tt>a-g</tt> represent the note names and <tt>0-6</tt> the different durations (whole note, half note etc). When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key <tt>0</tt> will insert a whole note at the cursor. Pressing the <tt>a</tt> key will append the nearest A. If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note name, it will use the last entered duration. There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen or flatten. Use +/- with the shift key to sharpen or flatten an existing note. Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration of a note. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key or mouse) the cursor turns green and then <tt>a</tt>-<tt>g</tt> edits the note name. To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike <tt>A</tt>,<tt>A-G</tt>,<tt>G</tt>. When the cursor is green the keys<tt> 0-6</tt> change the duration of the note, while Shift-<tt>0-6</tt> insert a note before the cursor. (If you use the numeric keypad you can use <tt>Shift-KP 0-6</tt> for this). The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while <tt>Alt-a-g</tt> add notes to the chord at the cursor. <tt>Ins</tt> inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue) a note, a double <tt>Del</tt>, <tt>Del</tt> removes it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle on a note-position. Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing the measure. Red indicates that the measure is already full. When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor or insert before it. The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.

For a more detailed description of Denemo’s various input methods, see <a class="Reference" href="#sec:A-Survey-of-Input-Methods">A Survey of the Input Methods↓</a>. You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system - e.g. under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot with the shortcut Control-period shown in blue next to the command. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu. There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam, Da Capo, cresc. etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere. When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help-&gt;Turn Excessive Tooltips (Off/On), and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing via Edit-&gt;Change Preferences.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
And once you have stopped playing around with the mouse for entering notes you can hide the palettes at the side to give more room for the music display (right click and Edit Palette).

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are a few of the keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Letters <tt>a-g</tt> edit the note at the cursor to be A-G, if the cursor is in the appending position then notes are added. Letters <tt>A-G</tt> (either <tt>CapsLock</tt> or <tt>Shift</tt>) insert a note at the cursor. 
</li>
<li>
Numbers <tt>0-6</tt> are used to refer to the note durations Whole Note ... 64th Note. They insert a duration at the cursor, which you then give a pitch to with a note name. With the shift key held (or the CapsLock on) <tt>0-6</tt> edits the duration of the note at the cursor. The corresponding Numeric Keypad keys can be used instead.
</li>
<li>
The period (<tt>.</tt>) dots a note, <tt>Ctrl-.</tt> removes a dot, on the numeric keypad Decimal (.) cycles through dotted, double-dotted, no-dot.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Alt-0-6</tt> inserts a rest.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Alt-a-g</tt> Add notes to a chord. Or position the cursor and use <tt>Insert</tt> to add a note, <tt>Ctrl-Insert</tt> to remove it. 
</li>
<li>
<tt>7</tt> starts a slur, <tt>8</tt> extends it, while <tt>9</tt> reduces it.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift-/</tt> inserts a cautionary accidental.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Esc</tt> switches between various views of the music which can allow more music on the screen at once.
</li>
<li>
<tt>TAB</tt> alternately inserts a start or stop triplet marker.
</li>
<li>
Multiply (<tt>*</tt> on the numeric keypad) ties/unties the note at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Divide (<tt>/</tt> on the numeric keypad) sets/usets the note at the cursor as a grace note.
</li>
<li>
Add/Subtract (<tt>+/-</tt> on the numeric keypad) sharpens/flattens the note at the cursor.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Two-key shortcuts are also available such as "<tt>B</tt>,<tt>s</tt>" for start repeat barline and "<tt>B</tt>,<tt>e</tt>" for end repeat barline.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Some Common Mouse Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are a few of the mouse shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo (keyboards may vary, for control, shift, alt etc modifiers). Note that under the Input menu is an option to turn on more mouse-friendly buttons, this is the default for Windows users.
</div>
<ul>
<li>
Scroll Wheel pans up/down to bring staffs out of view into the window.

Right-button click edits at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Double-click brings up the Object Inspector on the current object, from there you can launch the Object Editor.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Shift</tt>-right-button click edits things attached to the object at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Double click left-button describes the object clicked on.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl-Shift</tt> left-button drag allow you to move stuff in the display if it is cluttered. Typesettting is not affected.
</li>
<li>
<tt>Ctrl-Shift</tt> Key and Right mouse button gives the menu of directives to insert at the cursor.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.3">1.3</a> Some Common Uses of MIDI in
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions. Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names at the pc-keyboard). With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be used for this too). If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it is played on a different channel, so that you are alerted to possible pitch spelling errors (e.g. inputting A-sharp for B-flat). By holding down the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key a score can be checked by playing the notes - the cursor only advances if the correct note is played, and the <tt>Shift</tt> key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output (e.g. to check a phrase before playing it in). There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too. The Pitch Bend controller can be used to set the range of sharps and flats to be used, and the modulation controller can be used to mark sections of the music. With the MIDI controller set as Input source (Input menu) the duration keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown) - you can enter as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes on top.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.4">1.4</a> Note and Rest Entry Palettes
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
On starting Denemo for the very first time a series of palettes are placed near the main window with buttons to insert and change notes. For more serious use these just waste space, so by right clicking on them and choosing Edit this Palette they can be hidden.
</div>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Part-II">Part II.</a> Using Denemo
</h1>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> General Concepts
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single file (with .denemo suffix). This is represented on the screen by a "tab". If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tab.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (<tt>PgUp</tt>, <tt>PgDown</tt>), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu. A movement is a continuous piece of music with titles etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
When you have more than one movement numbered buttons appear in the score titles bar for you to navigate by. The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental is the movement number.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically). Each Denemo Staff has in turn a Denemo Voice and within the voice are the Denemo Objects. These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes and Denemo Directives (see <a class="Reference" href="#sec:Denemo-Directives">Denemo Directives↓</a>). The staff properties include things like the number of lines (usually 5) while the voice properties include the default direction of the stems.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully typeset). The Denemo Directives are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples. They can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a chord, to a staff as a whole and to the score as a whole; in this case the directive can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Each Denemo Directive carries its own display method. For example the Close Repeat barline appears as a Denemo Object in the input display, while a Directive attached to a staff (e.g. Instrument Name, or Smaller Staff Size) will display a &ldquo;tools&rdquo; button to the right of the staff. Another tools button appears if directives are attached to the voice within a staff, again to the left of the clef, below the staff one. Clicking these tools buttons allows you to edit the staff/voice properties using the staff/voice editor.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing - the clef is drawn pale and there is no timesignature for such extra voices so it is easy to understand what is going on. The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance. The staff in this case is a dummy, any properties set on it would be ignored.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited. It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one and green when editing (i.e. on an already entered object).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular action, but also each menu item lets you add the command to a palette, enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts for the action. A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key while the menu item is selected. All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself. The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.g. working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.). When you place a command in a palette you can add to an existing palette or create a new one - you can choose or create any number of these, free-floating or docked in the main display. Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions - often by modifying ones that are already there - using the Scheme scripting window.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When a file is loaded it opens at the point where you left off editing it. The position and size of the window is restored as well as the position and size of the source pdf you are transcribing from.

<div class="Indented">
The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and/or right hand side. Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu. At the bottom is a status line showing which movement you are in and what sort of object the cursor is on. If there are any MIDI filters that active they will be noted at the right in the status bar. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area. When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on. By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space for more of the music. If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still scroll the display to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can hide staffs in the display if needed using the Staffs-&gt;Display Effects menu. If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu), and arrange a "page view" of the input music - useful when using playback.

Use the <b>File</b> menu to perform global operations related to storing and retrieving from file systems, importing from MusicXML, MIDI, and LilyPond formats, printing full score or parts, exporting to MIDI, Ogg, Wav, LilyPond (parts or score), PDF and Png formats. This is also where you open PDF files containing source material - e.g. manuscripts - that you wish to transcribe or proof-reading comments you wish to incorporate in your score. Another sort of source material can be loaded from here - audio files can be loaded for transcribing as well as MIDI files.

The New command starts a new score, while New Tab creates an empty score while leaving the current score open - a line of tabs appears at the top of the display for switching between these. Note that you do not have to have multiple scores open to copy and paste between scores - opening a new score does not alter the clipboard.

<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--1"></a>Open Submenu

<div class="Unindented">
The Open command (Ctrl-o) opens a Denemo file for editing. Open Template opens one of the templates provided with Denemo - this is like open except the file once opened becomes untitled, forcing you to give it a name on saving. Open Example is similar, but here the scores are intended as examples of how to do particular things - they can also serve as a place to copy and paste from. Open Custom Template opens the directory where templates you have created with Save Template are stored. If you create a template called Default.denemo then the command Open Default Template will load it (Ctrl-n). Add Staffs and Add Movements take staffs or movements from the Denemo file chosen and add them to the current score. Open inNew does a combination of New Tab and Open.

<div class="Indented">
Open Source Audio loads an audio file creating empty measures with the audio displayed as a series of note-onsets in a line at the top of the display. The note-onsets can be dragged to achieve synchronization and tempo-matching between the notated bars and the audio. You can then add the notes (by ear) and play the two in sync to listen for discrepancies. This is best explained by the video demos (see <a class="URL" href="www.denemo.org">www.denemo.org</a>).

<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Note: Dynamics, Slurs, Trills, Tempo Indications etc are in the Notes/Rests menu (if attached to a note or chord) or Directives menu (if standalone objects) . The advantage of attaching them to a note is that they can be moved around as a unit, but the standalone objects are generally easier to drag in the Print View should that be needed.
</div>

</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.1">3.6.1</a> Score Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The score menu lets you control things that apply to all the movements of the current score. Also here is the Check Score command which should be your first port of call if your score will not typeset.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Score Properties command gives access to some built-in properties that affect the whole piece - paper size and display apperance. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Score Properties Editor command runs the <a class="Reference" href="#sec:The-Score-and">10↓</a>Score and Movement Properties Editor, open on the Score Editor pane.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--6"></a>Titles Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
There are two sorts of titles. Book titles have a separate title page with titles for individual movements which can be listed in an automatically generated table of contents. Simple titles give a Title and (optionally) movement titles on the same page. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Comments (&ldquo;Critical Comments&rdquo;) can be placed on chords/notes/rests in the score and these can be automatically collected into an appendix using the Book Titles-&gt;Epilog submenu.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A Table of Contents can be automatically generated from the movement titles by setting Book Titles-&gt;Table of Contents Title.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Graphic title pages can also be created. These can be created by invoking the Inkscape vector graphics editor from within Denemo, or using it externally to create the title page. A sample title page is included both as an encapsulated postcript (EPS) file and as a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file. The latter is the form to use for editing the page to suit your needs, but it should also be saved as an EPS file as this is the format used to include it in the typeset score.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--7"></a>Typesetter Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Here such things as the overall font size to typeset the score, the rules for spacing system, any global transposition, control of page numbering etc can be set.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The beaming rules can be set both in general (invoke Set Beaming Rules without a selection) or with exceptions (by invoking with a selection that has been beamed manually using the [ and ] commands from the Notes/Rests-&gt;Beaming menu). Use this latter to break up very short notes, for example, that would otherwise be beamed together while leaving the longer durations as normal.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.2">3.6.2</a> Movements Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
As with the Score Menu there may be Denemo Directives attached to the movement - e.g titles to be placed at the head of the movement will have a Denemo Directive associated with them. Other controls that can be applied on a per-movement basis include the barline and notehead style, printing of a custos at line ends, the indent before the first system (which can also be set on the score-wide basis).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Various score checking routines work at movement level from this menu and a command to re-bar the movment (or a staff or part of a staff) is also here as &ldquo;Adjust the Measure Lengths&rdquo; - this can also be used just to check that the Denemo &ldquo;measures&rdquo; correspond with the actual typeset measures (which always follow the durations/time signatures).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Again there are titles menus for either simple or book titles, and for inserting graphics between movements. These can be used as decorative separators between movements or to insert columns of verses at the end of songs (each song is a separate &ldquo;movement&rdquo;).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.3">3.6.3</a> Staff/Voices Menu

</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--8"></a>The Staff Properties Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This covers such things as the type of staff (e.g. Normal Notation, Tablature, Chord Symbols, Fret Diagrams) as well as the staff appearance and the playback instrument, instrument name or ambitus to be typeset at the start of the staff and more.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--9"></a>The Add Staff Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This allows adding staffs to the current movement. Piano staffs can be added as well as specialized sorts of staff for dynamics, marks (so that they appear once for all layouts), and coulés (diagonal lines positioned between thirds in some music). The Add Structured Staff command duplicates the current staff with regard to measures and time signature changes, ready for the insertion of music.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--10"></a>The Voices Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
<i>Voices</i> in Denemo are like staffs but are typeset on the preceding staff to achieve single-staff polyphony. The Denemo Display is normally set to display any extra voices on a separate staff so as to make it easy to work with - the voices have their clef displayed in yellow and do not show a key signature as these are supplied by the main staff (or &ldquo;primary voice&rdquo;). Voices will also normally be assigned to voice numbers 1,2,3,4 using the Initial Voice commands in this menu (this controls the stemming, slur positions etc). Voices can change their voice number during the music - the commands for this are in the Directives-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Voices menu as they insert stem change objects in between the notes.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--11"></a>The Display Effects Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Here you can choose to hide staffs from the display so that you can see distantly placed staffs side by side (e.g. in large orchestral scores). If you are using this and navigating with the keyboard you will want to reset the key shortcuts for staff navigation commands to use variants that skip over the hidden staffs.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can also give more/less room in the display to the staffs.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--12"></a>The Staff Groupings (Braces) Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The braces at the start of each system are controlled from here. The order that you add the braces determines which are outside which. The braces are displayed to the left of the staff and can be edited/checked there with the mouse.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.4">3.6.4</a> Clefs Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
All sorts of clefs can be selected - the Set Initial and Clef Change commands give access to standard clefs. The Clef Chooser command lets you set more exotic clefs such as Drum clef and even things like the Gregorian chant C clef using the LilyPond syntax (e.g. vaticana-do3).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Typeset-only and Display-only clefs enable you to work with a voice which is being typeset on a different staff, while keeping the music in the staff you wish to see it in or for entering music in a familiar staff which is to be typeset in an unfamiliar one.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.5">3.6.5</a> Keys Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Setting the initial key or a key signature change or to sharpen or flatten the key signature at the cursor. You can also click on the key signature itself to sharpen/flatten. The key signature can be hidden when typeset.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.6">3.6.6</a> Time Signatures Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Besides basic time signatures various variants (numeric, single digit ...) are here. There is also beaming control applying just to the current passage (for beaming rules for the whole score see the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu or for the whole movement Movement-&gt;Typesetter menu).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.7">3.6.7</a> Measures Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Besides commands to insert/delete/navigate/merge/split measures (in one or all staffs) this menu includes commands to set an upbeat (anacrusis, pickup) measure at the start, or a short measure (e.g. during partial first &amp; second time bars). First and second time bars markers themselves are to be found in the Directives-&gt;Markings-&gt;Spanning menu.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The whole measure repeat sign is here and some commands to check the measure for errors or to widen or narrow the measure in the display.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.8">3.6.8</a> Chords Menu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are commands to add notes to a chord either at the cursor, by note name or at an interval above the bass. Whole chords can have their enharmonic spelling changed up or down.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.9">3.6.9</a> Notes/Rests 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This covers inserting, deleting and modifying notes in pitch, duration and appearance and all sorts of things that are attached to note objects such as slurs, phrasing slurs, ties, beaming controls, ornaments (trill, turn ...), grace notes, articulations (staccato, tenuto ...), fingerings, textual markings, cresc. and dim. (both hairpins and extended cresc. — poco — a — poco style) chord symbols (&ldquo;fakechords&rdquo;), figured bass. Dynamic markings such as <i>f </i>and<i> p </i>are separate objects (see Directives-&gt;Markings-&gt;Dynamics). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Also here is the tuplet menu, for groups of notes that have a duration that is a fraction of the written duration, such as triplets. These actually insert tuplet start and end objects, before and after the notes concerned so, strictly speaking they should come in a separate miscellaneous objects category. As usual, the most useful commands have shortcuts already - Tab starts/stops a triplet alternately (so you can press it once, enter the notes and press it again to finish the triplet). And Keypad 7, Keypad 7 turns the note entered into a triplet of notes (with Control as well they are slurred). This is set as a two-key shortcut so that you can type it in as a triplet rhythm: e.g. the three keypresses 4, KP_7, KP_7 will give a triplet of three 1/16th notes.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--13"></a>The Append/Edit Note Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
So called because in appending position the note names a, b, c ... append a note while when the cursor is on an note it edits the note to have the note-name indicated. The other note edit commands here are shifting up and down an octave, sharpening or flattening. Cautionary and reminder accidentals are here too - to set the style of accidentals (e.g. if they are repeated in various circumstances) see the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--14"></a>The Note Insertion Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This menu has commands for inserting notes at (i.e. before the object at) the cursor position. The double key press A, A inserts the note A in the prevailing duration (more commonly people press a duration key 0, 1, ... followed by a note name).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you enter a note and then sharpen you will hear both note and sharpened note - to avoid this use the &ldquo;Sharpen Next Note&rdquo; command (likewise for flatten, use twice for double-sharp,flat) the default key presses are ’=’ and ’-’ for these.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--15"></a>The Append/Insert Duration Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
So called because the commands 0, 1, 2 ... append a note when the cursor is in the appending position or enter a note if the cursor is on an object. If you have a MIDI keyboard (and it is designated in the preferences under the MIDI tab) then the note will be purely rhythmic (yellow/brown) playing a pitch will turn it into a real note. Here is the command for entering a snippet (which can be a complete rhythmic pattern) as well as Breve and Longa for early music.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are also a set of comands for appending notes which will be slurred from previous notes (Control-0, etc) which means that you can enter slurs as you enter the rhythm of a bar without extra key presses (which would otherwise break the rhythm of your entry).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--16"></a>The Edit Duration Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Here are the commands for changing the duration of the note/rest/chord at the cursor as well as doubling or dividing the note at the cursor.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Besides commands for dotting notes there are commands for turning the note at the cursor into a dotted rhythm of two notes and for entering a dotted rhythm with two key presses (so as to keep in rhythm - e.g. 3, KP_9 gives dotted 1/8 note, 1/16th note, and the corresponding slurred one with Control).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--17"></a>The Rest Insertion Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Besides inserting rests (Alt-0 etc) you can insert non-printing rests (where voices are silent) and move rests out of the way in polyphonic situations where LilyPond doesn’t do what you want. Whole measure rests and multi-measure rests are here too with control over their numbering.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--18"></a>The Select Duration Submenu
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
The commands to explicitly set the prevailing duration are here (though usually this is set by inserting a duration) and, more importantly the command to select a snippet as the prevailing duration (Shift+ Space) after which entered notes follow the pattern of the snippet.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.10">3.6.10</a> Directives<a class="Label" name="sub:Directives"> </a> 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This covers all the things that aren’t notes but sit in between them. The most useful for regular music notation are barlines, dynamic markings, tempo marks, rehearsal marks etc in the Markings submenu. There is an enormous collection of stuff here though. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One general feature is the Conditional Directives which can be used to restrict a directive to a particular type of score layout (e.g. only to be used when printing a part, or a full score). This can be used, for example, to prevent a cue being printed on the full score (as it is only relevant when printing the part).
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.11">3.6.11</a> Lyrics 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
To add lyrics to a staff move the cursor onto the staff and choose Add Lyric Verse. You need to have the Lyrics View visible (see View menu). Each verse has a separate tab, with the current verse for the current staff being visible at any one time.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
This means that you will see the lyrics for the current staff disappear from the Display Window when you switch staffs, which can be disconcerting, but saves space in the display.
</div>

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Stanza numbers can be entered as well as font-changing commands. Use <tt>Melismata</tt> command to extend syllables over more notes. The lyrics menu also contains a command &ldquo;Edit Lyric at Cursor&rdquo; (Ctrl-l, Ctrl-l) which finds the place in the lyrics corresponding to the cursor position allowing you to edit the syllable that underlies the current note. Verses can be typeset in columns at the end by using command Typeset Verses at End which invokes the external Inkscape (or other) editor.

<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-3.6.12">3.6.12</a> Notation Magick Menu

<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-4">4</a> Palettes<a class="Label" name="sec:Palettes"> </a>
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Palettes are collections of commands arranged as a column, row or grid of buttons either in a separate window or docked in the Main Window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The buttons are not just for mouse users - palette buttons can be executed by clicking with the mouse or typing <tt>p</tt> followed by (part of) the label of the button followed by the <tt>Enter <i>or</i> Return</tt> key. (The palette must be selected - you can do this while typing the label or by using a button).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To make full use of the keyboard for executing commands from your palettes you should edit the labels so that they are easy to type &amp; memorable. Put the shorter ones first as you do not need to type all of the label, just enough to select the right button.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the View menu you can select palettes of commands to use. Right-clicking on a palette button allows you to edit the button or the entire palette. You can dock the palette in the main display, arrange it as a column, line or block and much more.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You should make palettes your best friend - when you find a command in the menu system that you need right click on it and choose Add to Palette. This way you will build up one or more collections of commands that you need. By right clicking on a palette button you can choose a label for the command that suits you, and even make special notes about its use in the tooltip.

Palette buttons can also be created directly from objects so that you can create more of them in your score; if you run Help-&gt;Open Feature Packed Score and find the type of object or attribute you need there then you can run the Object Editor on it and create a palette button for installing the same thing in your own score.

<div class="Unindented">
In the View menu you can show the Command Center. This has a list of all the Denemo commands, hidden or not, with their shortcut(s). The box at the top left gives full details of the currently selected command and its location in the menu system. Below that is a search box for finding any command you need by matching words in its description or label. By choosing &ldquo;Fuzzy&rdquo; you will make the search less strict - one word could be missing.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The search starts as you type in the first letter of any key words you want, so check after each letter to see if you have found the command you need. To search for further commands matching your keywords press the arrow next to the search box. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command center is also where you can set one-key shortcuts such as <tt>Ctrl-x</tt> and two-key shortcuts such as <tt>Shift-a</tt> followed by <tt>Shift-a</tt> (which is written as <tt>A</tt>,<tt>A</tt> next to the command). You can also look up which command responds to a given shortcut, and execute the selected command here.

</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6.1">6.1</a> Overview
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Music snippets are short selections from a voice which can be stored on the Snippet tool bar. They have two main uses: they can act as a repository of &ldquo;motifs&rdquo; which can be inserted (<tt>Ctrl-Space</tt>) at the cursor, and they can be used as an extension to the &ldquo;prevailing duration&rdquo; idea. In the second use, by selecting a snippet as you enter pitches the durations are assigned from the next step in the snippet. The first case is especially useful when entering a complex rhythm which is repeated many times in the piece. In all cases the snippet can contain all sorts of attributes and markings, slurs, beaming indications, ornaments etc, and these will then all be entered with a single keypress or as you add pitches.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-6.2">6.2</a> Details
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The Snippet tool bar has only one button initially: &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. This button lets you create a snippet from the current selection. The selection should be a contiguous selection of objects in a single voice. Once created the snippet appears on the snippet tool bar as a button - the label is generated to indicate the content, and this label can be further edited by clicking on the button and choosing &ldquo;Edit Label&rdquo;. Other options on clicking a snippet button are to insert the snippet, to select the snippet (in which case as you enter pitches they follow the rhythm of the snippet, including any slurs, trills, or articulations that are in the snippet) etc. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>Ctrl-Space </tt>inserts the selected snippet or (if none is selected) inserts the snippet that you specify by number. <tt>Shift-Space</tt> selects the next snippet (or first if none selected), to unselect a snippet choose a duration (0, 1...) to be used instead for entering pitches.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the insertion case, you may have two or three snippets that apply to a given score - special bits of text that appear over notes for example - and you can insert them using <tt>Ctrl-Space</tt>, 1 (or 2 or 3 ...) as needed.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
In the pattern-following case you will be selecting snippets using <tt>Shift-Space</tt> and then playing in notes (and backing up using backspace in case of error - the pattern backs up for you).

<div class="Unindented">
The print view window is shown by checking View-&gt;Print View. This view shows the typeset score as it will be printed on paper. It also allows you to locate the place in the Denemo Display belonging to a particular note or mark in the score, and allows some graphical editing of the score.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7.1">7.1</a> The Buttons
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Print starts your system’s print dialog to send the typeset score to a printer or file.
</li>
<li>
PDF to generate a PDF document from the score.
</li>
<li>
Typeset. Offers a menu of score layouts to typeset. If only one is available (the Default Score Layout) then it typesets that one.
</li>
<li>
Movement. Creates a Score Layout comprising the current movement, and then typesets it .
</li>
<li>
Part. Creates a Score Layout from the current Part and typesets that. A <i>part </i>comprises all the staffs with the part name of the current staff. (The part name of a staff is shown above the initial clef with a green patch on it).
</li>
<li>
Refresh. Repeats that last typeset command. For example, if Part was the last then it typesets the current part (which may be different from the one last typeset).
</li>
<li>
Continuous/Manual. This both indicates the current mode of typesetting and acts as a menu for altering it and choosing how much to typeset in continuous mode. In continuous mode the score is re-typeset every time it is altered - choose the range if the score is large so that it refreshes quickly. For entering music rapidly set this to Manual, and re-typeset on demand.<ul>
<li>
Range opens the range dialog. You can set the range by selecting &ldquo;All Movements&rdquo;, &ldquo;Current Movement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cursor Context&rdquo;. In this last one you can select the number of bars before and after the cursor and the number of staffs above and below the cursor to typeset. Note that if you select too small a range the typesetting may be different, as the small amount of music will be spaced differently to appear well typeset.
</li>

</ul>

</li>
<li>
Duplex. Changes the view to show how two-sided printing will work out for page turns.
</li>
<li>
Next, Previous. Navigate to the next/previous page of the score. You can scroll or drag as well.
</li>

<div class="Unindented">
The mouse scroll wheel enables vertical panning and with Shift horizontal panning. With Control pressed you can zoom the view, which is very important for re-shaping slurs. Right click for help with tweaking beam angles, slurs etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Right clicking in a blank area of the typeset view (normal cursor) gives a menu providing help and allowing you to typeset with the control points for curves and the location points of objects marked as red dots and crosses. Be sure to turn off these red dots and crosses before printing or creating a customized score layout, as they are embedded in the score.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7.3">7.3</a> Editing in the Print View
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Clicking on the typeset score can locate the place in the Denemo Display belonging to it. For this to work look for the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; pointer as you move the mouse over the typeset score. Use a big enough zoom factor to make this easy. The hand pointer indicates a place where if you click the Denemo Cursor will move to the Denemo Object that belongs to that feature. The navigation works for noteheads, slurs, ties and various marks - some other things such as lyrics can’t be used to navigate - choose the note that the lyrics underlie to find the right place in the Denemo Display.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7.4">7.4</a> Editing Positions and Padding
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Right clicking on objects in this pane allows you to drag items that LilyPond has positioned badly. Alternatively, you can select an amount of padding to apply to some objects so that they keep their distance from other items in the score. This is generally a better way of indicating that it is too close to something else, since other objects will move away from it as needed - that is, if you later edit something it will behave more intelligently.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7.5">7.5</a> Re-shaping Slurs and Ties
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Slurs and beaming can also be altered here. When you right-click on a slur or tie the Denemo Cursor moves to the note where the slur starts and you are offered the chance to edit the shape of the curve. Choose a large zoom factor before you begin, and turn on the control points (red dots and crosses) as described <a class="Reference" href="#sub:Mouse-Controls">Mouse Controls↑</a>above. Then right click on the curve and choose Edit Shape. You have to click on the reference point first - this is on the center-line of the staff at the horizontal position of the notehead where the curve starts - this is marked with a red dot. Then you click and drag on the four &ldquo;control-points&rdquo; that define the shape of the curve. Once the shape looks good, right click in a blank area and click Apply. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
With practice you can skip the use of the red dots and crosses as you can guess where they would be.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-7.6">7.6</a> Adding Line or Page Breaks.
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Page or line breaks added by right-clicking on a note at a barline and choosing from the menu. This works because right-click positions the Denemo Cursor at the note and then the page or line break command is run just as if you were working directly in the Denemo Display.

<div class="Unindented">
The Object Inspector is shown by clicking View-&gt;Object Inspector, or just double-clicking on an object in the Denemo Display. It gives comprehensive information about the object at the cursor. This includes directives like ornaments, dynamic markings, fingerings that may be attached to the object. For objects like notes and rests which start at a particular musical moment it also describes at what moment in the measure the note begins and what its duration is.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Object Inspector is sensitive to which note of a chord the cursor is on, so that things like fingerings (which can vary from note to note within a chord) are displayed individually as you move the cursor up and down a chord. You can step through the notes of a chord using the button marked &ldquo;Inspect the next note in chord&rdquo; which will work upwards through the notes before wrapping round to start at the lowest note.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For many directives full information about which command created the directive and where it is to be found in the menu system is given, and the description of the command’s behavior.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Some older commands don’t have full information but the tag associated with the directive will usually help in tracking it down.
</div>

This window is <i>modal, </i>that is you cannot interact with Denemo outside of the editor until you have dismissed it. To warn you of this the pointer turns to an X if you try to interact with the Denemo Input Display when the Object Editor is still open. Buttons are provided to move on to editing the next (or previous) object. For each Denemo Directive (either standalone or attached to the chord or note) there is a button &ldquo;Edit command: &lt;<i>name of command</i>&gt;&rdquo; - the tooltip of this button gives the help text of the command that created it. This button will run the command in edit mode. There are also buttons to do a low-level edit (Advanced) or to delete the directive.

<div class="Unindented">
The Object Editor also has buttons for creating Palette Buttons for the Denemo Directive that it edits. There are two of these: one button would run the command that created the attribute/object the other will instantiate a duplicate - a clone - of the attribute/object.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-9.2.1">9.2.1</a> Create Button for Command

<div class="Unindented">
This creates a palette button to run the command that created the Denemo Directive you have Object Editor open on. You are asked which palette you want to place the button in, and can create a new, custom, palette at that stage.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, if you use this on the Arranger attribute of a score you will get a button that runs the command Arranger (which is found in Score-&gt;Titles...). That button would then ask you to fill in the name of the arranger. Compare this with the next button, where you will create a button that will install a clone of Arranger attribute that you have on this score - the arranger will be already filled in, saving you having to enter your own name each time you create a new score.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-9.2.2">9.2.2</a> Create Button for Clone
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
This creates a button which when clicked will insert a duplicate of the Denemo Directive that the Object Editor is looking at.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This means that for any specific attribute you want to re-use you can create a button that will install exactly that Denemo Directive at the cursor. So, even if you do not know how a particular effect was generated, you can create a palette button to use the effect in your own score. The Open-&gt;Open Example scores provide useful examples of things you may need. See the section on Palettes<a class="Reference" href="#sec:Palettes">4↑</a> for more about palettes.

Use the Score menu to launch the editor with the Score properties expanded fully and the Movement menu to launch it with the Movement properties expanded - they are combined in a single window to make it easy to switch between them. Drag the separator if you need to switch between them. On the Movement Editor pane there are buttons to change movement, so you can continue editing without re-starting the editor.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The built-in staff properties can be edited using the button at the top.

Clicking on these opens the Staff and Voice Properties Editor.

</div>
<div class="Indented">
In this directory there are commands to control the number of systems per page or bars per system - these would only be needed in exceptional circumstances. There are also commands to control how systems are laid out on the page, and on the last page (the Ragged * commands), and to control the margins.

<div class="Unindented">
Commands to control beaming are available for individual notes, whole passages of notes and entire scores. Mostly the default beaming will be what you want. An exception is the beaming in 3/4 time which can look like 6/8 when beamed in the traditional manner. Use Object Menu-&gt;Time Signature-&gt;Beam at Half Measure to alter the default.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Individual beam control commands are located in Notes/Rests-&gt;Beaming. The start/stop beam shortcuts are usually [ and ]. Other commands include providing partial breaks in the beaming and stopping beaming on a note.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Setting beaming for the whole score can be done using ObjectMenu-&gt;Score-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Set Beaming Rules. Either the general rule can be given, or Beam Exceptions can be set from the selection. To use the latter, set up a measure or measures with the beaming manually set using the Individual beam controls and then select the passage and invoke Set Beaming Rules.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Setting beaming for a passage can be done with ObjectMenu-&gt;Time Signatures-&gt;Set Beaming Rule. In addition, at a time signature change a beaming rule can be set using ObjectMenu-&gt;Time Signatures-&gt;Time Signature with Beaming Rule.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
After automatic beaming has been turned off use ObjectMenu-&gt;Directives-&gt;Typesetter-&gt;Start Beaming to insert a directive re-starting automatic beaming at the cursor. The Cadenza On/Off commands turn on/off automatic beaming (as well as the timing control).
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15.2">15.2</a> Barlines
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The important thing to know about barlines in Denemo is that they are not just graphical marks on paper - e.g. you cannot put a repeat end barline followed by a repeat start barline and expect both to print - instead you must use a repeat-end-start barline. This is because you are telling Denemo about the music, not about how to draw it - the repeat-end-start barline is drawn completely differently if it occurs at the end of a line, for instance.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another useful thing to understand is that the &ldquo;barlines&rdquo; that appear in the Denemo display are not really barlines at all, just a convenient breaking up of the music into &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;. Normally, of course, you will use one chunk per measure so they <i>will</i> correspond with the typeset barlines.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There is a relationship between line/page breaks and barlines: you cannot have line/page breaks at any point in the music, there must be a barline there. However this can be a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; barline, so that option is in the menu too.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
One curious consequence of this is what happens if you contrive to input notes that are timed so that a note is always playing at every barline; normally you use tied notes for this, but if (by mistake) you leave one bar short in duration you can find that none of the following typeset bars start with a note, and the result is that the line cannot be broken - it extends off the right hand side of the page.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15.3">15.3</a> Ties and Slurs
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
... and phrasing slurs. It is important to distinguish ties from slurs since they often look the same in the typeset music, but in some circumstances they are typeset differently - so you may think the music looks ok, and later after some editing, it looks wrong - you have hit a situation where the typesetting distinguishes the two. To help with this Denemo shows distinguishes slurs with little green and red markers for the start/end, while the ties are heavier horizontal curves. If you import music from other notation programs they often confuse slurs and ties, so a command to fix these is in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Tied Notes menu. (In the unusual case of slurred notes of the same pitch - e.g. open string/stopped note on a violin - you would have to correct the error by hand).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Also in this menu are commands to tie individual notes in chords, to control the direction (up/down) of ties and to adjust the shape of ties which can be very tricky to position nicely in tight situations.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The commands for slurs are in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Slurs menu. The most useful have the shortcuts 7,8,9 to slur from the current note to the next note, to extend the slur and to reduce it. There are also commands to turn on/off a slur start or slur end, and these are also in the right-click menu on the notes in the Denemo Display.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When entering rhythms with the numeric keypad the slurs can be added without breaking rhythm by using the control key with the rhythm. So, for example, Ctrl-3 enters a 1/8 duration slurring from the previous note, or extending the slur. And Control keypad 9 (Ctrl-KP_9) creates a slurred dotted rhythm (corresponding to keypad 9 which creates a dotted rhythm based on the last entered duration) and similarly Ctrl-KP_7,Ctrl-KP_7 for entering a slurred triplet based on the current duration.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Phrasing slurs are slurs over the top of ordinary slurs, used in Romantic music and later. The display just shows where they start and end, the typesetter allows only one level of nesting slurs as that is all that is used in music. More would require a non-printing voice carrying the extra layers of slurs.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-15.4">15.4</a> Triplets and Friends
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Collectively called &ldquo;tuplets&rdquo; these are handled in Denemo by two markers, one beginning the tuplet which holds the timing change and the other a simple end tuplet marker. The Denemo Display only knows how to display tuplets that start and end in the same bar, but the typesetter is not restricted in that way. You can stop and re-start the tuplets at measure breaks so that the Denemo Display understands what you mean, and control the placement of tuplet numbering and tuplet brackets using the Tuplet Brackets and Tuplet Numbering commands in the same menu. The typeset can also cope with nested tuplets perfectly well, though the Denemo Display will be strange.

There are specific commands for the more common tuplets, and arbitrary tuplets can be started using the Arbitrary Tuplet command - you give the numbers to denote the fraction that the timing is changing by (e.g. triplets are 2/3 of the duration written so you give 2,3). If you wanted 7 notes in the time of 4 you would give 4, 7 so that the durations changed by 4/7, after seven 𝅘𝅥𝅮-notes you would have the equivalent of 4 𝅘𝅥𝅮-notes duration.

<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Grace Notes present a peculiar problem to the LilyPond typesetter that Denemo uses. As they do not have any duration it gets into difficulties if there are other things (such as time signatures, double bars etc) going on at the same time. The problem arises when other parts are also sounding and they don’t have the same grace notes. There is a command in Denemo to work around this by installing &ldquo;grace note hints&rdquo; - these are dummy non-printing grace notes in the other parts. This is done automatically by the Check Score routine, so normally you don’t have to run it yourself, but it is in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Grace Notes menu. It is good to be aware of this however, as you will see these pale yellow rests that declare themselves to be grace notes in the music sometimes.

In some circumstances it is desirable to place dynamics in a separate <i>Dynamics Staff. </i>This is often the case for the dynamics centered between piano staffs; it ensure that hairpins align with each other and that other dynamic markings are placed consistently. It also allows for positioning of dynamics markings other than directly on notes - they can be placed at slightly later or earlier times. To do this notes of shorter duration are put in the dynamics staff and the dynamic markings are attached to them. The notes are just dummy notes to indicate the timing of the onset of the dynamic attached.

</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-16.1">16.1</a> Introduction
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo allows you to explore all the actions (insert/delete/edit/navigate...) using the menus. So, for example, inserting notes can be found under Notes/Rests while inserting a Staff comes under Staffs/Voices. When you have found the action you need hovering over the item will give an explanation of what it does. The keyboard or mouse shortcut to use for the command is in blue on the right. You can set the keyboard shortcut just by pressing the desired key while the menu item is selected. You can right click on the menu item to set a a two-key keyboard shortcut. This means that you can tailor Denemo to allow you to use your preferred method of entering notes.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
By default, Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you need you can consult the menu system to find out. This method is good for touch typists.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-16.2">16.2</a> Playing Notes into Denemo - MIDI
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo can take pitches directly from MIDI input. Select Input-&gt;Midi Input. The control panel allows you to choose the enharmonic range, the default centers around the initial key signature (e.g. E-flat to G-sharp for C-major). If you enter a diminished or augmented interval the note will be played in a separate MIDI channel which can be used to alert you to pitch-spelling mistakes (e.g. entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented and dimished intervals if you have the enharmonic range set wrongly for your piece). 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The best way to use the MIDI keyboard is enter the music firstly as pure rhythms using the pc-keyboard, ignoring the note names. The durations show as yellow/brown notes. Each duration makes a distinctive sound as you enter the durations. As you start each measure a sound is made so that you can keep your eyes on the score you are copying from, without needing to look up and check that you haven’t miss-typed. If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you have entered the rhythms for one or more measures you can play the notes via MIDI - the cursor automatically goes to the start of the rhythms you have entered. As you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you have notated. By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play it twice - once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches. If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals used to match the score, the pitch spelling facility will alert you to this. (If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point, but this isn’t needed for MIDI in).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Under Input-&gt;MIDI are various "MIDI filters" that allow you to control how the MIDI input is used: with none active the behavior is as if you had entered the notes using the pc-keyboard, but with the following advantages 
</div>
<ul>
<li>
The octave, accidental and note name are all entered in one press of the MIDI key. The cursor automatically advances so you can continue to play in notes.
</li>
<li>
The duration keys enter the yellow/brown duration-only notes, when you play a MIDI key the cursor automatically moves to the first of these.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Alt</tt> key (or sustain pedal) lets you enter chords.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Ctrl</tt> key lets you check the pitches of a piece already entered. The cursor only advances if the note played is the one at the cursor.
</li>
<li>
Holding down the <tt>Shift</tt> key lets you listen to the MIDI keyboard without affecting the score.
</li>
<li>
The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo’s simple pitch-spelling strategy. The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F - B-flat.
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever you wish. One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the bass note. Another is the "AngryDelete" filter. With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI filters are found under Input -&gt; MIDI
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-16.3">16.3</a> Playing Notes into Denemo - Audio (Soundcard Mic Input)
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of the computer; it doesn’t attempt to guess the rhythm - such systems do not work well - but you will find that playing the notes in time will help you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience rather than a chore.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note. If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals at the computer keyboard. Using the headphones-out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off" interfering with the pitch detection. Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification - it is worth getting the level right before you begin.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When you select the Input-&gt;Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition window pops up. While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive to pitches heard via the microphone input. The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will be entered into the score. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There are two ways of using the pitch entry - Overlay mode (default) and Insert mode. The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure in the prevailing rhythm - the mode is set to Insert for this. The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the pitches you sound. There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical instrument tuner.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor. If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected. You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them altogether if you want to start over in a measure. If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the cursor position.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when you enter the given pitch - you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic instrument.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If you don’t have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone, in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument to get reliable detection. Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones. To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in – the notes should all turn blue if you have perfect detection. It is worth while getting perfect detection – more than one or two miss-detects per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay method.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes. You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting the rhythm. In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn’t involve entering the rhythm separately. For this select Input-&gt;Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up. With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm. The same applies if you have MIDI - by choosing a rhythm (e.g. half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.

<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-16.4.1">16.4.1</a> Note Entry
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Basic Note entry is to type a number key <tt>0-6</tt> for the duration of the note followed by a letter key <tt>a-g</tt> for the note name. (The shorter duration notes are available, but the keys <tt>7</tt>,<tt>8</tt>,<tt>9</tt> are used for starting and extending/reducing slurs). If the duration is the same as the last entered note then just the note name is needed. The duration can be dotted with the period key, and the octave adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When you append music by pressing a duration key with a MIDI controller active, you get a brown note, indicating a duration which has not been given a pitch. Once you have pressed a note-name it becomes that note printed in black. Prior to that it is a pure rhythm and will play back as a drum beat and will print as a space.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
When not appending music, you need to use the <tt>shift</tt> key to insert a new note, or set the <tt>Caps Lock</tt>. So <tt>Shift-a</tt>,<tt>Shift-a</tt> inserts the note A etc. Plain <tt>a</tt> edits the note at the cursor to be an A. Likewise with the numeric keypad the <tt>Shift</tt> key can be used to edit a note duration, while the plain number keys insert the duration of the note at the cursor. (If you do not have a numeric keypad, you have to use the number keys - best to plug in an additional USB keyboard with numeric keypad, they are very cheap nowadays).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Rests are entered with <tt>Alt-0 Alt-1 ...</tt>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Spacer rests (that is non-printing rests as seen in keyboard polyphony) have shortcuts too <tt>Mod4-0</tt> etc, where <tt>Mod4</tt> is the key with a flag on it. However, on Windows machines you will need to reclaim the <tt>Windows</tt> Mod-4 key from Microsoft or re-define the shortcuts, e.g. to <tt>Shift-Alt-0</tt> etc.

</div>
<div class="Indented">
Select the File-&gt;Open menu and the item Open a Source for Transcribing. Select the PDF containing the music to be transcribed from. The PDF is opened in a Source View window. Right-click in this window at the point that your transcription will start. This will create a link - a Denemo Directive Object - in your score at the Denemo cursor position, shown as arrow icon. If you later use a right-click on this Denemo Directive the source file will be re-opened with the blue highlight marker on that point in the score. (Depending on the position of the top of the page you may need to scroll the Source View window up or down to bring it into view).

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-20.1">20.1</a> Transposition
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo has much better transposition facilities than the common music notation programs such as Sibelius, Finale and Musescore. If you have used those programs you are probably thinking &ldquo;I need to transpose this music&rdquo;, meaning you are going to change all the notes and chords you have entered along with the key signatures. You <b>can </b>do this in Denemo (see Physical Transposition<a class="Reference" href="#sub:Physical-Transposition">20.1.1↓</a>) but usually it is far better just to say that you want score to be typeset in the new key. This takes care of everything in one go - even footnotes that refer to the pitches of notes in the music will transpose (unless you have entered them as fixed values). And your input music stays looking just as you entered it - essential if you have to look back and compare with a source for instance.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The commands to tranpose a score are in the Score-&gt;Typesetter menu. &ldquo;Transpose on Print&rdquo; is a graphical user interface - you get presented with a new tab containing two notes - clicking the Transpose button will transpose so that the first pitch will be typeset as the second one. The initial values a C and E♭ (up a minor third) so by typing G this would become up a fifth. The first note could be changed as well, if you know that D should become F♯, for example, then you can make those the two notes.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The other command is quicker but more technical - (Print) Transposed lets you type in the names of the two notes. The technical bit is how you specify sharp and flat and which octave. To specify sharp the note is followed by &ldquo;is&rdquo;, for flat &ldquo;es&rdquo; (these are actually the Dutch names!). Octaves are indicated by ’ for up and , for down, so for example c c,, would mean transpose two octaves down.

<div class="Unindented">
In the case where you have changed your mind and want the actual notes you have entered to be altered the commands to do this are in the Notes/Rests-&gt;Transpose menu. The most general of the commands are Arbitrary Transpose Down and Arbitrary Transpose Up. These allow you to describe the interval you want to transpose the music by e.g. m7 for a minor seventh, d5 for diminished 5th. Alternatively you can use two pitches to describe the interval as in the previous section. Note that these commands work on the note/chord at the cursor or the selection; any key signatures will need changing separately if needed.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-21.1">21.1</a> Adding and Editing Key/Mouse Shortcuts
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Denemo allows you to choose which keys activate which commands (shortcuts). It also allows you to choose Mouse press/release gestures (in combination with keys such as <tt>Shift</tt>, <tt>NumLock</tt>, <tt>CapsLock</tt> etc).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
See <a class="Reference" href="#sub:The-Command-Center">The Command Center↑</a> for setting shortcuts. The following quicker method can also be used for one-key shortcuts. To choose a shortcut for a menu item, select the item (it becomes highlighted) and press the key that you want to become the shortcut. If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command, you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or steal the shortcut. Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say the <tt>NumLock</tt> down and those without or to ignore it. If the <tt>NumLock</tt> is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting of <tt>NumLock</tt> is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the <tt>NumLock</tt> was off.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist in bright blue lettering. PrsL-<tt>CapsLoc</tt>, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the <tt>CapsLock</tt> light is on. In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so that together with the RlsL-<tt>CapsLoc</tt> for the release of the left mouse button, you can "draw" slurs by using the mouse. Similarly, <tt>Shift</tt> with left mouse button (MveL-<tt>Shift</tt>) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff. (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For mouse shortcuts and to change the pointer shape during mouse operations invoke the Command Center with the right click on the menu item. The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking on the big button. The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 90%;">
Mouse Shortcuts are tricky to set - you are able to control what happens on mouse button press and release, which can be used to do things like drag notes up and down. But they are tricky to set up!

</h2>
<h3 class="Subsubsection-">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection--19"></a>Adding More Features 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with. Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as to keep the menu sizes manageable. Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default setup. Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-1"></a>An example - quicker dynamics selection
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
It can be slow to choose dynamics (<tt>Ctrl-D</tt>) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse). You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available as for example: (define DenemoDynamicList ’(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127" "Piano"))) This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano available by pressing down arrow Return. (The others via More of course). If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then it will be defined when you start Denemo.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-21.2.1">21.2.1</a> Recording a Denemo Macro 
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
You can also get Denemo to record a frequently used sequence of actions - it can be installed in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut just like any other command. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
To do this choose View-&gt;Scheme Script. (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!). In the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set of steps you wish Denemo to record.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
As a simple example, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?). You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if that is your shortcut). (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command entered into the Scheme window). Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window. To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit-&gt;Customize Commands...-&gt;Manage Command Set-&gt;Save as Default Command Set). If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you exit. Otherwise you can re-load via the More-&gt;My Commands menu item. 
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-21.2.2">21.2.2</a> Editing a LilyPond Tweak
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which is by modifying a tweak that has already been done. This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive (usually found under the Advanced button provided in the Object Editor<a class="Reference" href="#sec:Object-Editor">9↑</a>). Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter. You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be positioned.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command, and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above. An alternative to creating a command in the menu system is to create a palette button (see the Object Editor<a class="Reference" href="#sec:Object-Editor">9↑</a>).
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-22">22</a> Writing Scheme Scripts 
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme Script window to create any command you want. Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt other scripts to do what you want.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive into the score. This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories in the same way as the menu system itself). Then choose Get Script from the right click menu. With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window. Here you can see the part that says
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<span class="environment"><span class="arrayrow">
<span class="arraycell align-l">
(d − DirectivePut − standalone − postfix"RehearsalMark""
</span>

</span>
<span class="arrayrow">

default")
</span>

</span>
</span>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
which is inserting the LilyPond directive "\mark \default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark. (The extra backslashes are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean a \ sign). You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need - always doubling the \ signs. The you can save as a new menu item, or use Save Script to customize the script you started with.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available. Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined.

Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument is passed to them from Scheme. In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value" is passed these will be used and no popup will occur. The field "name" will be given the value "value". The \0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings. As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass the value. The names of the fields depend on the action being called. So for example:
</div>
<div class="Indented">

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-22.10">22.10</a> LilyPond Editing
</h2>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-2"></a>Introduction
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within Denemo. This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.g. multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo. The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which you can use.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable template or example file exists). Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep separate LilyPond files.
</div>
<h3 class="Subsubsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsubsection-22.10.1">22.10.1</a> Using the LilyPond Window
</h3>
<div class="Unindented">
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with the LilyPond output in it. The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show the various sections or to create custom versions. The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo file.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between editing textually and editing in Denemo.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text. LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout). There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current Denemo object. Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo window cursor to move in synchronism.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond text in the window. This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them, or even make a temporary edit for just one print. If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered. So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.
</div>
<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-3"></a>Detail
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same music input. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group of staffs or even a piano reduction. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons. These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as "MvmntIVoiceIMusic" and so on. Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks) and the text inserted will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you are editing. (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just before the note name - one of the arrow keys will do).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score layout and selecting create custom score layout. The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI. If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print command prints, e.g. both a full score and parts. Using the \book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder .denemo in your home folder).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression \MvmntIVoiceIMusic. This means that the same music can be output in several different ways, so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<tt>MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {\MvmntIVoiceITimeSig \MvmntIVoiceIKeySig \MvmntIVoiceIClef} </tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>MvmntIVoiceIMusic = {\MvmntIVoiceIProlog \MvmntIVoiceI}</tt>
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
Where \MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other definitions hold the time signature, clef etc. By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do if you never look at the LilyPond window. What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part. However, if you use the File-&gt;Print command then it prints the first custom scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do not have any custom scoreblocks).
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<div class="Shadowbox" style="width: 100%;">
Clicking (as opposed to using the arrow keys) in the LilyPond text does not move the cursor in the Denemo window. When you delete a LilyPond directive textually you have to move the cursor to start re-inserting it.

By saving a Denemo score with a script defined (in the script window) you can create music lessons, automatic midi player... the possibilities are endless. When you open such a score, the script is run - it can take user input and manipulate the score, or do other actions as your fancy takes you.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There is a special score init.denemo that is run on startup. By editing this you can startup with whatever template and whatever actions you wish to be performed. If you set it to do something that quits Denemo, you may need to delete the file before using Denemo normally again. Your local init.denemo is stored in the directory .denemo/actions in your home directory.To create it put the script you want in the script window and use SaveAs selecting ~/.denemo/actions/init.denemo as your file to save to.

<div class="Unindented">
Denemo Directives give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can be changed by the user.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score and can modify the behavior of the element concerned. They contain fields to describe how the element’s properties should be modified, either in the display or in the printing. Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows. This means Denemo can grow - you can add features - without getting a new version.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo. Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to them.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start of the score and just before each movement. The display field is shown at the top of the display.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
scoreheader: Attached to the score. The postfix field is put inside a \header{} block at the start of the score.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement. The prefix field is placed before the movements \score{} block, the postfix after it.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
header: Attached to a movement. As scoreheader but for \header{} blocks inside the movement’s score block.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
paper: Attached to the score. The postfix is placed inside a \paper{} block.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
layout: Attached to a movement. The postfix is placed inside a \layout{} block in the movement’s scoreblock.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures. (e.g. used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element - it comes with the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and the postfix after it.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the postfix after it. Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc. Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic) and tx, ty for the display text.
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.

<div class="Indented">
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note and field is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set. For example:

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the LilyPond output.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
postfix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
prefix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
display - text to be shown in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
tx,ty - where to show the text in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
graphic - For directives that are in the music this is a .png image to be shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these). The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -&gt; Save Graphic command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required. For directives attached to the score, movement etc the string set here will be displayed on the button in the button box for that sort of directive (see Show Score Titles etc in view menu for showing this button box).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
gx,gy - where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
minpixels - how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
override - Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo display for the item. A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional information not explicit in the music notation (e.g. the tempo of an Adagio marking).
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
midibytes - a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation is given by the MIDI bits in the override field
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The override field contains the following bits:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND: override the LilyPond output normally used at this point, rather than adding to the normal output. The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC: overrides what Denemo would normally show in the display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME: the MIDI velocity to use
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION: affects the duration of a note. not yet implemented

<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_REPEAT: indicates that an earlier passage should be repeated (from a directive of the same tag). not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">

</div>
<div class="Labeling">

</div>
<div class="Unindented">
The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE: the value in midibytes is to be used just for the item the directive is attached to. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP: the value in midibytes is to be used from this point on
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP: the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting value, a corresponding directive (i.e. with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated between these. not yet implemented
</div>
<div class="Labeling">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE: value in midibytes is used relative to the current value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.g. an absolute velocity etc)

<div class="Paragraph">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Paragraph-4"></a>Introduction
</div>
<div class="Unindented">
Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic - a button then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive. Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below). Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it. What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name of the directive. For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMark" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname). This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly. The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirective EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.

They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup. The functions and variables for script editing are:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels. More useful commands RadioBoxMenu and RadioBoxMenuList are built on this for a nicer interface.
</li>
<li>
Extra-Offset tag type context. Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited, which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond context of the object. Only tag is required. Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
</li>
<li>
SetPadding tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li>
<li>
SetRelativeFontSize tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it shifts the font size of the following text in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li>
<li>
CreateButton tag label this is just a convenience function to put a button with the passed in label onto a button box at the top of the screen. Scripts can attach actions to such tagged buttons.
</li>
<li>
d-SetDirectiveTagActionScript tag scheme-actions. This command sets scheme-actions as the actions to be performed when the button of the given tag is clicked. The default action is to run any editscript associated with tag, and if none to run the d-DirectiveTextEdit-score on the directive that displays the button.
