name="idp33504"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>Denemo lets you create musical scores. You can type music in using the keyboard 
    or play it in using a MIDI contoller or the microphone input. You can edit your music - the input display window shows you what you
    are working on in music notation - and you can playback to check how it sounds. 
    The Print View window shows the final printed score and typeset to the highest standards used in the music publishing industry 
    - thanks to the Lilypond music typesetting program.</p><p>This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of music notation programs.
     Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positioning of notation is possible on the final typeset display.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Getting Started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp36256"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><p>Most people will start with playing around with Denemo via the pc keyboard. The default setup means that keys a-g represent the note names and 0-6 the different durations (whole note, half note etc). When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key "0" will insert a note at the cursor. Pressing key "a" will append the nearest A. If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note name, it will use the last entered duration. There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen or flatten. Use +/- with the shift key for editing. Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration. 
</p><p>When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key right or mouse) the cursor turns green and then a-g edits the note name. To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike A,A-G,G. When the cursor is green the keys 0-6 change the duration of the note, while Shift-0 6 insert a note before the cursor. (If you use the numeric keypad you can use Shift-KP 0-6 for this).  The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while Alt-a-g add notes to the chord at the cursor. Ins inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue) a note, a double Del, Del removes it. 
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
  When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle on a note-position. Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing the measure. Red indicates that the measure is already full. When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor or insert before it. The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.
</td></tr></table></div><p>
 </p><p>You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system - e.g. under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot with the shortcut Control-period shown next to the command.
 Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu. There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam, Da Capo, cresc. etc etc).
 </p><p>
     Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere. When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help-&gt;Turn Excessive Tooltips (Off/On), 
     and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing via Edit-&gt;Change Preferences.
 </p><div class="sect2" title="Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm192"></a>Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts</h3></div></div></div><p>Here are a few of the keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo.

      Numbers 0-6 are used to refer to the note durations Whole Note ... 64th Note. They insert a duration at the cursor, which you then give a pitch to with a note name. With the shift key held (or the CapsLock on) 0-6 edits the duration of the note at the cursor. The corresponding Numeric Keypad keys can be used instead.

</p><p> Two-key shortcuts are also available such as "B,s" for start repeat barline and "B,e" for end repeat barline. 
 </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Some Common Uses of MIDI in"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp51632"></a>Some Common Uses of MIDI in</h3></div></div></div><p>The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions. Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names at the pc-keyboard). 
With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be used for this too). 
If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it is played on a different channel, so that you are
alerted to possible pitch spelling errors (e.g. inputting A-sharp for B-flat). By holding down the Control key a score can be checked by playing the notes - the cursor only advances if the right note is played, and the Shift key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output (e.g. to check a phrase before playing it in). There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too. The Pitch Bend controller can be used to set the range of sharps and flats to be used, and the modulation controller can be used to mark sections of the music. With the MIDI controller set as Input source (Input menu) the duration keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown) - you can enter as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes on top.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"></div><p>Denemo is used via the computer keyboard, MIDI controller or playing in via a musical instrument.
     Clicking on a musical item in the score moves the cursor to it,
      and the status bar at the bottom will describe the item clicked. 
      Double-clicking the item will describe it in more detail.
      Right-clicking on items in the score allows you perform the most common edits on it.
        Clicking on the initial clef, key or timesignature lets you edit these,
         clicking to the right or left of the measures visible moves you forwards and backwards in the score.
           Selections can be made by dragging with the mouse from one note to another or off to one side (the window then scrolls). 
           And right-clicking any menu item gets help and the opportunity to set a shortcuts for the menu item.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Overall View of Denemo"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp55568"></a>Overall View of Denemo</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="General Concepts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp56208"></a>General Concepts</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single file (with .denemo suffix). This is represented on the screen by a "tab". If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tab.
 </p><p>
    One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (PgUp, PgDown), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu. 
    A movement is a continuous piece of music with titles etc.
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">
  When you have more than one movement numbered buttons appear in the score title bar for you to navigate by. 
  The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental is the movement number. 
</td></tr></table></div><p>
 </p><p>
    Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically) and within the staffs Denemo Objects. These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes
     and Denemo Directives (see  <a class="xref" href="#DenemoDirectives" title="Denemo Directives">the section called &#8220;Denemo Directives&#8221;</a>). The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully typeset). 
     The Denemo Directives are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples. 
     They can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a chord, to a staff as a whole and to the score as a whole; in this case the directive can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to. Each Denemo Directive carries its own display method. For example the Close Repeat barline appears as a Denemo Object in the input display, while a Directive attached to a staff (e.g. Instrument Name, or Smaller Staff Size) may appear in a menu under a tools icon to the right of the staff. In the case of "Smaller Staff" the directive directs the LilyPond typesetter to make the staff smaller, and it can be edited from the menu under the tools icon to the left of the clef. Another tools icon appears if directives are attached to voices within a staff, again to the left of the clef, below the staff one.
</p><p>
    If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing - the clef is drawn pale and there is no timesignature for such extra voices so it is easy to understand what is going on. The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance.
    </p><p>
    In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited. It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one and green when editing (i.e. on an already entered object).
    </p><p>
        There are two sorts of titles. Book titles have a separate title page with titles for individual movements which can be listed in an automatically generated
table of contents. Simple titles give a Title and (optionally) movement titles on the same page. Comments can be place on chords in the score and these can be automatically collected into an appendix.
    </p><p>When a file is loaded it opens at the point where you left off editing it. 
 The position and size of the window is restored as well as the position and size of the source pdf you are transcribing from.
    </p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="The Denemo Input Window"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp63856"></a>The Denemo Input Window</h2></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a name="idp64672"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 1. Main Window</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/denemomain.png" alt="Main Window"></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>
The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and right hand side. Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu.
At the bottom is a status line showing which movement you are in and what sort of object the cursor is on. If there are any MIDI filters that active they will be noted at the right in the status bar. The small colored rectangle is the Denemo Cursor, which shows where notes etc will be added/edited next - the insertion point is marked as a blue vertical bar. Selected music is indicated by a green background.
</p><p>
In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area. When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on. By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space for more of the music. If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still drag the red bar upwards to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance.
If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu), and arrange a "page view" of the input music - useful when using playback.
</p><p>
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular action, but also each menu item lets add the command to a palette, enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts for the action. 
A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key while the menu item is selected. 
All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself. 
The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.g. working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.).
When you place a commands in a palette, and you can choose or create any number of these, free-floating or docked in the main display. 
Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions - often by modifying ones that are already there - using the Scheme scripting window.

You can enter notes following a rhythmic pattern of a snippet. If you have a pattern in your music that appears many times you only need to type it once. By selecting it and clicking Create Snippet you install that snippet on the toolbar. Then as you enter notes (in Insert Mode) the notes follow the rhythmic pattern chosen. Pressing a duration key goes back to adding notes of the prevailing duration. You can have several snippets like this and switch between them using the space bar (or other keybinding of your choice). Another (more musical) way of entering rhythms is to "drum" them in using the keys on the computer keyboard for quarter-note, eighth-note etc, a curious sort of "musical instrument" where you change key for different durations. Use the numeric keypad for this. Drumming in is quickly learnt and, by playing in the notes rhythmically you can keep your place in the music. Use the immediate feedback option for this, so that you get a bell to confirm when you have completed a measure.</p><p>
   The snippets toolbar is also where "special" notes such as Breve, Longa will appear.
</p><p>Using Input-&gt;Midi or Audio allows you to enter pitches directly. If you have entered your piece of music as pure rhythm you can overlay with the pitches using a MIDI controller or musical instrument with mic, headphones out or pickup attached to your soundcard.

Right click for help with tweaking beam angles, slurs etc.</p><p> Right clicking in this pane also allows you to drag offsets to apply to items that LilyPond has positioned badly. 
 Slurs and beaming can be altered here, and page or line breaks added.
 Or you can select an amount of padding to apply to some object. 
 This is generally a better way of indicating that it is too close to something else, 
 since other objects will move away from it as needed - that is, if you later edit something it will behave more intelligently.

 You can customize any layout in this window - positioning lyrics above the staff rather than below for example, or setting the staff groupings.
 </p><p>You can make Denemo Directives conditional on the score layout, 
so that for example a page break only applies when printing the full score, or is just for printing one part.

        In addition other score-wide settings create buttons on the score titles bar and movement wide settings on the movement titles bar.

        Denemo allows you to explore all the actions (insert/delete/edit/navigate...) using the menus. So, for example, inserting notes can be found under Notes/Rests while inserting a Staff comes under Staffs/Voices.
         When you have found the action you need hovering over the item will give an explanation of what it does.
        The keyboard or mouse shortcut to use for the command is in blue on the right.
         You can set the keyboard shortcut just by pressing the desired key while the menu item is selected. 
         You can right click on the menu item to set a a two-key keyboard shortcut or mouse shortcut to activate the action.
         In addition you can customize the mouse actions to initiate commands, and set the cursor that will show while certain mouse conditions apply.
      </p><p>
          Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), 
      playing in acoustically using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system. 
      </p><p>
          Using the menus for everything would be very slow, but next to each menu item is the keypress that you can use instead. 
      If there is no keypress shown, and you want to use that item often, then right click on the menu item and you can set a key combination for that menu action. 
      Right clicking is also useful for getting a description of what the menu action is. 
      </p><p> 
        Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you need you can consult the menu system to find out. This method is good for touch typists.
      </p><p class="persom">For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method.
      </p><p>
          One way to do this is enter the music as pure rhythms, ignoring the note names. 
          The durations show as yellow/brown notes. Each duration sounds its own pitch and length as you enter the durations. 
          As you start each measure the bell will sound so that you can keep your eyes on the score you are copying 
          without needing to look up and check that you haven't miss-typed. If you are a reading musician 
          you will find that you tap in the rhythm rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering. 
      </p><p>Once you have entered the rhythms for one or two measures you play the notes via MIDI - they automatically fill in the rhythm for you. When you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you have notated. By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play it twice - once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches. If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals used to match the score. If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point, but this isn't needed for MIDI in.

            Denemo can take pitches directly from MIDI input. Select Input-&gt;Midi Input. 
            The control panel allows you to choose the enharmonic range, the default centers around the initial key signature (e.g. E-flat to G-sharp for C-major).
            If you enter a diminished or augmented interval the note will be played in a separate MIDI channel which can be used to alert you to pitch-spelling mistakes 
            (e.g. entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented and dimished intervals if you have the enharmonic range set wrongly for your piece).
            Under Input-&gt;MIDI are various "MIDI filters" that allow you to control how the MIDI input is used:

             The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo's simple pitch-spelling strategy.
             The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F - B-flat.
           </li></ul></div><p>

           The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever you wish. One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the bass note. 
        Another is the "AngryDelete" filter. With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI filters are found under Input-&gt;MIDI
        </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="subtitle">Playing Notes into Denemo - Audio (Souncard Mic Input)</h4></div></div></div><p>
        Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of the computer; it doesn't attempt to guess the rhythm - such systems do not work well - but you will find that playing the notes in time will help you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience rather than a chore.
        </p><p>Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note. 
         If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be much faster for you than typing note names, 
         octave shifts and accidentals at the computer keyboard. Using the headphones out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off" interfering with the pitch detection.
          Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification - it is worth getting the level right before you begin.
          </p><p>When you select the Input-&gt;Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition window pops up. While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive to pitches heard via the microphone input. The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will be entered into the score. </p><p>There are two ways of using the pitch entry - Overlay mode (default) and Insert mode. The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure in the prevailing rhythm - the mode is set to Insert for this. The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the pitches you sound. There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical instrument tuner.</p><p>
        Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor. If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected. You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them altogether if you want to start over in a measure. If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the cursor position.
        </p><p>Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when you enter the given pitch - you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.</p><p>Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.</p><p>Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic instrument.</p><p> The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.</p><p> If you don't have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone, in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument to get reliable detection. Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones. To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in &#8211; the notes should all turn blue if you have perfect detection. It is worth while getting perfect detection &#8211; more than one or two miss-detects per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay method.</p><p>
            The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes. You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting the rhythm. In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.</p><p>Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn't involve entering the rhythm separately. For this select Input-&gt;Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up. With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm. 
              The same applies if you have MIDI - by choosing a rhythm (e.g. half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) 
              and playing in the pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using the Denemo From the PC keyboard"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp345232"></a>Using the Denemo From the PC keyboard</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="subtitle">Note Entry</h5></div></div></div><p>Basic Note entry is to type a number key 0-6 for the duration of the note followed by a letter key a-g for the note name.
          (The shorter duration notes are available, but the keys 7,8,9  are used for starting and extending/reducing slurs).
           If the duration is the same as the last entered note then just the note name is needed. 
           The duration can be dotted with the period key, and the octave adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).
        </p><p>When you append music by pressing a duration key with a MIDI controller active, you get a brown note, indicating a duration which has not been given a pitch. 
            Once you have pressed a note-name it becomes that note printed in black. 
            Prior to that it is a pure rhythm and will play back as a drum beat and will print as a space.
        </p><p>
            When not appending music, you need to use the shift key to insert a new note, or set the caps lock. So Shift-a,Shift-a inserts the note A etc. Plain "a" edits the note at the cursor to be an A.  Likewise with the numeric keypad the Shift key can be used to edit a note duration, while the plain number keys insert the duration of the note at the cursor. 
            (If you do not have a numeric keypad, you have to use the number keys - best to plug in an additional USB keyboard with numeric keypad, they are very cheap nowadays).
        </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="subtitle">Chord Entry</h5></div></div></div><p>
            The standard keybinding for entering a note in a chord is the Insert key, Del,Del deletes. This enters the note at the cursor position, use - and = to flatten/sharpen the note before you enter it (avoiding hearing both notes if you flatten/sharpen afterwards).
           There are also commands to enter a named note Alt-a, Alt-b... are the standard shortcuts for this.
           Spacer rests have shortcuts too, but on Windows machines you will need to reclaim the "Windows" Mod-4 key from Microsoft or re-define the shortcuts.

                The PDF is opened in a Source View window. Right-click in this window at the point that your transcription will start.
                This will create a link in your score at the cursor, 
                which can be clicked on to open the source view window with the blue highlight marker
                on that point in the score. 
                (Depending on the position of the top of the page you may need to scroll the Source View window up or down to bring it into view).
                When you re-open the score to check or edit at some point you can click on a nearby link and the source file will be opened and the position highlighted once again.
        </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="subtitle">Taking Snapshots of a Facsimile</h4></div></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">This feature is now largely redundant as you can use the above method, which is quicker to do</td></tr></table></div><p>
        This is particularly useful for difficult-to-read scores. Each measure of the original can be captured as an image and stored along with the Denemo measure that is your transcription. This makes the transcribing process much easier as you can glance at your original without losing your place in a large messy manuscript. Capturing the images of the measures is done using a screenshot type of process - you need to have the original visible on the screen so you can indicate the extent of each measure.
        </p><p>
        First display the original score or part on the screen using your pdf viewer or other image display software. Then, in Denemo, choose one of the Capture Measures commands. For a Full score you can capture all the parts at once - choose Movement-&gt;Capture Score-&gt;Capture Measures (Score). If you have parts use Staff-&gt;Capture Score-&gt;Capture Measures (One Staff).
        </p><p>
        Now you can continuously enter measures by left clicking at each measure. You can adjust the start position of the measure (which is normally the end of the last one) by right-clicking. As you enter a measure image a Denemo measure is entered into the score and the image placed underneath it. To stop entering images press a key on the keyboard. There are also commands to delete an erroneous measure-image and to insert a new one - N.B. when you delete the image for a measure all the other measures shift along by one, so they are under the wrong bars until you insert a new screenshot for the measure.
        </p><p>
        Now you can transcribe the music straight from the images directly under the measure you have selected. 
        <a class="ulink" href="http://www.denemo.org/dl21" target="_top">LaManina.denemo </a> is an example: the original print made in Venice is quite difficult to decipher and has a couple of errors. In this Denemo file each measure for each part can be seen directly beneath the transcription. 
        You will notice that in places the original measure was split across two lines; at the moment there is no mechanism for joining up the two halves, so instead the following measure has an image containing the remainder of the measure plus the next measure.

    For mouse shortcuts right-click the menu item and choose the Create Mouse Shortcut, to change the pointer shape during mouse operations invoke the Command Center with the Edit Shortcuts option. 
    The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking on the big button. 
    The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it.

 </p><p>
    If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command, you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or steal the shortcut. 
    Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say the NumLock down and those without or to ignore it. 
    If the NumLock is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting of NumLock is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the NumLock was off.
 </p><p>
 The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist in bright blue lettering. 
 PrsL-CapsLoc, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the CapsLock light is on.  
 In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so that together with the RlsL-CapsLoc for the release of the left mouse button, 
 you can "draw" slurs by using the mouse. Similarly, Shift with left mouse button (MveL-Shift) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff. 
 (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor).

It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with. Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as to keep the menu sizes manageable. Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default setup.
Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.
</p><div class="sect3" title="An example - quicker dynamics selection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp398048"></a>An example - quicker dynamics selection</h4></div></div></div>
It can be slow to choose dynamics (Ctrl-D) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse).
You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available as for example:

(define DenemoDynamicList '(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127" "Piano")))

This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano available by pressing down arrow Return. (The others via More of course).

If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then it will be defined when you start Denemo.

You can also get Denemo to record a frequently used sequence of actions - it can be installed in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut just like any other command. </p><p> To do this choose View-&gt;Scheme Script. (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!). In the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set of steps you wish Denemo to record.
  </p><p>As a simple example, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?). You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if that is your shortcut).
  (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command entered into the Scheme window). Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window. 
 To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) 
 and choose "Save Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.

 </p><p> You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit-&gt;Customize Commands...-&gt;Manage Command Set-&gt;Save as Default Command Set). If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you exit. Otherwise you can re-load via the More-&gt;My Commands menu item.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Another way ..."><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp403888"></a>Another way ...</h3></div></div></div><p>
   There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which is by modifying a tweak that has already been done. This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive (usually found under the Advanced button provided by an edit script). Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter. You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be positioned.
  </p><p>
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command, and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Writing Scheme Scripts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp406608"></a>Writing Scheme Scripts </h3></div></div></div><p>
 If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme Script window to create any command you want. Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt other scripts to do what you want.
 </p><p>
 A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive into the score. This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
 </p><p>
 For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories in the same way as the menu system itself). Then choose Get Script from the right click menu. With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window. Here you can see the part that says
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
             (d-DirectivePut-standalone-postfix "RehearsalMark"  " \\mark \\default" )
</li></ul></div><p>
which is inserting the LilyPond directive "\mark \default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark. (The extra \s are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean a \ sign). You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need - always doubling the \ signs. The you can save as a new menu item, or use Save Script to customize the script you started with.
 </p><p> 
 More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available. Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined.

  Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument is passed to them from Scheme. In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value" is passed these will be used and no popup will occur. The field "name" will be given the value "value". The \0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings. 
  As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass the value. The names of the fields depend on the action being called. So for example
</p><div class="example"><a name="schemecalls"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 1. </b></p><div class="example-contents">
(d-Open "filename=myfile.denemo")

  Denemo directives are things like special barlines, rehearsal marks that appear amongst the notes, as well things like trills that are attached to notes and modifications
   to other things in the score to give them a different appearance or behavior. If they are objects in their own right ("Standalone Directives"), 
   like the first time bar marker then they appear betwen notes
   and the cursor can be placed on them. If they are attached to other things (such as a page break attached to a movement) then they are modified with the command used to create them.
  </p><p>
  Double clicking on Standalone Directives, gives information about the directive, while right-clicking will edit it.
  </p></div><div class="sect1" title="LilyPond Editing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="idp447520"></a>LilyPond Editing</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp448160"></a>Introduction</h3></div></div></div><p>
From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within Denemo. This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.g. multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo. The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which you can use.
  </p><p>
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable template or example file exists). Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep separate LilyPond files.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using the LilyPond Window"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp450816"></a>Using the LilyPond Window</h3></div></div></div><p>
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with the LilyPond output in it. The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show the various sections or to create custom versions. The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo file.
 </p><p>
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between editing textually and editing in Denemo.
   </p><p>
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text. LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout).
 There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current Denemo object.
  Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo window cursor to move in synchronism.
  </p><p>
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond text in the window.  
This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them, or even make a temporary edit for just one print.
 If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered. So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Detail"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp454512"></a>Detail</h3></div></div></div><p>
Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same music input. 
For example, a full score or a set of parts, 
or several voices on group of staffs or even a piano reduction. 
  </p><p>
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons. These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as
"MvmntIVoiceIMusic" and so on. Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks)
and the text inserted will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window. 
 </p><p>The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you are editing. (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just before the note name - one of the arrow keys will do).
  </p><p>
Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score layout and selecting create custom score layout. 
The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI.
If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print command prints, e.g. both a full score and parts. Using the \book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder .denemo in your home folder).
</p><p>
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression \MvmntIVoiceIMusic. This means that the same music can be output in several different ways, so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
  </p><p>
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {\MvmntIVoiceITimeSig \MvmntIVoiceIKeySig \MvmntIVoiceIClef}
</li><li class="listitem">
MvmntIVoiceIMusic = {\MvmntIVoiceIProlog \MvmntIVoiceI}
</li></ul></div><p>
Where \MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other definitions hold the time signature, clef etc. By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
  </p><p>Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do if you never look at the LilyPond window. What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part. However, if you use the File-&gt;Print command then it prints the first custom scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do not have any custom scoreblocks).

By saving a Denemo score with a script defined (in the script window) you can create music lessons, automatic midi player ... the possibilities are (literally) endless. When you open such a score, the script is run - it can take user input and manipulate the score, or do other actions as your fancy takes you.
</p><p><a name="initDotDenemo"></a>
There is a special score init.denemo that is run on startup. By editing this you can startup with whatever template and whatever actions you wish to be performed. If you set it to do something that quits Denemo, you may need to delete the file before using Denemo normally again. Your local init.denemo is stored in the directory .denemo/actions in your home directory.To create it put the script you want in the script window and use SaveAs selecting ~/.denemo/actions/init.denemo as your file to save to.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="What Happens at Startup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp484192"></a>What Happens at Startup</h3></div></div></div><p>On starting the scheme script ~/.denemo-(version number)/actions/denemo.scm is executed (where ~ means your home directory and version number is 1.1.2 or later).

  These give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can be changed by the user.
  </p><p>
 Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score and can modify the behavior of the element concerned. They contain fields to describe how the element's properties should be modified, either in the display or in the printing. Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows. This means Denemo can grow - you can add features - without getting a new version.
  </p><p>
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo. Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to them.
  </p><p>
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start of the score and just before each movement. The display field is shown at the top of the display.
</li><li class="listitem">
scoreheader: Attached to the score. The postfix field is put inside a \header{} block at the start of the score.
</li><li class="listitem">
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement. The prefix field is placed before the movements \score{} block, the postfix after it.
</li><li class="listitem">
header: Attached to a movement. As scoreheader but for \header[] blocks inside the movement's score block.
</li><li class="listitem">
paper: Attached to the score. The postfix is placed inside a \paper{} block.
</li><li class="listitem">
layout: Attached to a movement. The postfix is placed inside a \layout{} block in the movement's scoreblock.
</li><li class="listitem">
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</li><li class="listitem">
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</li><li class="listitem">
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures. (e.g. used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
</li><li class="listitem">
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff
</li><li class="listitem">
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
</li><li class="listitem">
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element - it comes with the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
</li><li class="listitem">
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and the postfix after it.
</li><li class="listitem">
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the postfix after it. Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc. Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic) and tx, ty for the display text.
</li></ul></div><p>

  </p><p>
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.
  </p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note  and field  is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set. For example
<div class="example"><a name="schemecalls"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2. </b></p><div class="example-contents">
 (d-DirectivePut-note-postfix "LHFinger" "3")

This function returns the value in the field or #f if there is no directive with the given tag at the cursor.
</li><li class="listitem">
d-DirectiveDelete-type type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note. This function returns #t or #f if a directive with the given tag was deleted.

 The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the LilyPond output.
  <p>
The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
postfix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</li><li class="listitem">
prefix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before  the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</li><li class="listitem">
display - text to be shown in the Denemo Display
</li><li class="listitem">
tx, ty - where to show the text in the Denemo Display
</li><li class="listitem">
graphic - For directives that are in the music this is a .png image to be shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these). The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -&gt; Save Graphic command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required. For directives attached to the score, movement etc the string set here will be displayed on the button in the button box for that sort of directive (see Show Score Titles etc in view menu for showing this button box).
</li><li class="listitem">
gx, gy - where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display
</li><li class="listitem">
minpixels - how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display
</li><li class="listitem">
override - Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo display for the item. A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional information not explicit in the music notation (e.g. the tempo of an Adagio marking).
</li><li class="listitem">
midibytes - a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation is given by the MIDI bits in the override field
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
The override field contains the following bits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND : override the LilyPond output normally used at this point, rather than adding to the normal output. The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC : overrides what Denemo would normally show in the display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive
</li></ul></div><p>
The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME : the MIDI velocity to use
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION : affects the duration of a note. not yet implemented
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_REPEAT : indicates that an earlier passage should be repeated (from a directive of the same tag). not yet implemented
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL : midibytes field gives the MIDI channel to use (? implemented?)
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO : midibytes field gives the tempo to use.
</li></ul></div><p>
The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE : the value in midibytes is to be used just for the item the directive is attached to. not yet implemented
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP : the value in midibytes is to be used from this point on
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP : the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting value, a corresponding directive (i.e. with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated between these.  not yet implemented
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE : value in midibytes  is used relative to the current value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.g. an absolute velocity etc)
</li><li class="listitem">
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_PERCENT : value in midibytes is interpreted as percentage value. not yet implemented
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
These flags are combined together to get the combination required for the directive using the scheme procedure called logior.</p><p>Here is an example, making a step-change in volume of 0x40 in the MIDI output, and printing "più mosso" in the output score </p><p></p><p>;;;;;;;;;; piu mosso</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-minpixels "StepTempo" 20)</p><p>(d-CursorLeft)</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-override "StepTempo" (logior DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE))</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-midibytes "StepTempo" "40")</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-display "StepTempo" "piu mosso")</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-postfix "StepTempo" "^\\markup {\\bold \\italic \"più mosso\"}")</p><p>(d-RefreshDisplay)</p><p>In this example the directive is a standalone directive. MIDI commands are being extended to apply to chords and notes.

    Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic - a button then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive. Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below). Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
  </p><p>
   The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it. What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name of the directive. For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMark" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
  </p><p>
   There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname). This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly. The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirective EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.
  </p><p>
   The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
 (d-DirectiveTextEdit-&lt;field&gt; &lt;tagname&gt;). Where &lt;tagname&gt; specifies the directive to be edited and &lt;field&gt; is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
   For example     (d-DirectiveTextEdit-paper "PrintAllHeaders") gives low-level access to the directive setting the print all headers command in the paper block of the LilyPond output.

Each menu can have an initialization script, which can contain procedures that would be too time consuming to define every time they are needed. These scripts are guaranteed to be run before any menu item is activated within the menu. They can be read/written using the right click menu on any scripted menu item.
</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Edit Scripts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp536304"></a>Edit Scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Each directive has a tag field, so that it can be recognized by the scripts that manipulate it. In particular for each tag there can be an edit script, for editing a directive of that tag. 
   Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept. </p><p> 
You can read and write edit scripts by using the low level editing dialog on a directive with the tag you are writing for. 
</p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">The low level editing dialog is the one that is presented if there is no edit script. Edit scripts can themselves give access to this dialog by including an option cue-Advanced which calls (d-DirectiveTextEdit-field tag) for the appropriate field and tag. For an example see the edit script for Instruments -&gt; Orchestra -&gt; RehearsalMark.

 </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.
</li><li class="listitem">
Extra-Offset tag type context. Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited, which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond context of the object. Only tag is required. Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
</li><li class="listitem">
SetPadding tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li><li class="listitem">
SetRelativeFontSize tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it shifts the font size of the following text in the LilyPond engraving process.
</li><li class="listitem">
CreateButton tag label this is just a convenience function to put a button with the passed in label onto a button box at the top of the screen. Scripts can attach actions to such tagged buttons.
