\begin_layout Standard
Denemo lets you create musical scores.
 You can type music in using the keyboard or play it in using a MIDI contoller
 or the microphone input.
 You can edit your music - the input display window shows you what you are
 working on in music notation - and you can playback to check how it sounds.
 The Print View window shows the final printed score, typeset to the highest
 standards used in the music publishing industry - thanks to the Lilypond
 music typesetting program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This separation of the final typesetting window from the input display avoids
 the constant dragging about of overlapping notation which is typical of
 music notation programs.
 It also means you are less likely to input a slur when you mean a tie,
 or a whole note rest when you mean a whole measure rest, for example -
 these often look similar in the typeset and are easily confused, but Denemo's
 input display makes clear the distinction.
 Nevertheless, if you do wish to tweak the appearance dragging and re-positionin
g of some notation is possible on the final typeset display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Some Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the terms well-known to musicians, music notation has some specialized
 names and Denemo uses some terms with specific meanings which you should
 know:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A
\emph on
 movement
\emph default
 is a continous stretch of music (all the measures following on from each
 other) such as a song in a songbook, or a movement in a symphony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
score
\emph default
 is one or more movements usually interspersed with titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
staff
\emph default
 has the usual meaning, but note that it may contain several lines of music
 (voices).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A 
\emph on
system 
\emph default
is what might be called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the music, that is all the music (over several staffs) that sounds together
 starting at the left-hand margin and ending at the right margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Staff Spaces
\emph default
 a unit of measurement: the distance between two staff lines.
 Generally when you need to specify a distance in Denemo this is the unit
 used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/index.html"

\end_inset

is a good guide especially for non-native speakers of English.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Input Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most people will start with playing around with Denemo using the mouse,
 but by the time you are reading this you will want something more efficient.
 Try using the pc keyboard.
 By default, keys 
\family typewriter
a-g
\family default
 represent the note names and 
\family typewriter
0-6
\family default
 the different durations (whole note, half note etc).
 When the cursor is appending (blue) pressing key 
\family typewriter
0
\family default
 will insert a whole note at the cursor.
 Pressing the 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 key will append the nearest A.
 If the duration of the next note is the same you can simply type the note
 name, it will use the last entered duration.
 There are keypresses (+/-, and plus/minus on the numeric keypad) to set
 sharp/flat/double-sharp/double-flat for the next entered note and to sharpen
 or flatten.
 Use +/- with the shift key to sharpen or flatten an existing note.
 Likewise, Shift with a number key edits the duration of a note.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the cursor is moved on to a note (with the arrow key or mouse) the
 cursor turns green and then 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
-
\family typewriter
g
\family default
 edits the note name.
 To insert a note before a note at the cursor use a double strike 
\family typewriter
A
\family default
,
\family typewriter
A-G
\family default
,
\family typewriter
G
\family default
.
 When the cursor is green the keys
\family typewriter
 0-6
\family default
 change the duration of the note, while Shift-
\family typewriter
0-6
\family default
 insert a note before the cursor.
 (If you use the numeric keypad you can use 
\family typewriter
Shift-KP 0-6
\family default
 for this).
 The arrow keys move the cursor around, the period key adds a dot while
 
\family typewriter
Alt-a-g
\family default
 add notes to the chord at the cursor.
 
\family typewriter
Ins
\family default
 inserts a note in a chord whether the cursor is on (green) or after (blue)
 a note, a double 
\family typewriter
Del
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Del
\family default
 removes it.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When in the appending position the cursor shows as a large blue or red rectangle
 on a note-position.
 Blue indicates a note can be appended at that point without overflowing
 the measure.
 Red indicates that the measure is already full.
 When the cursor is a smaller green rectangle it indicates that you are
 not in the appending position: you can edit the note/object at the cursor
 or insert before it.
 The vertical blue line indicates the insertion point.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a more detailed description of Denemo's various input methods, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:A-Survey-of-Input-Methods"

\end_inset

.
 You can find more shortcuts by exploring the menu system - e.g.
 under the Notes/Rests menu the Select Duration submenu gives Remove Dot
 with the shortcut Control-period shown in blue next to the command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively, a list is available in the Help menu.
 There are thousands of commands in Denemo, so get to know the Command Center
 where you can search for commands by key words such as slur, ossia, beam,
 Da Capo, cresc.
 etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, Denemo starts with tooltips popping up almost everywhere.
 When they become too annoying you can tame them with Help->Turn Excessive
 Tooltips (Off/On), and you can further delay the remaining tooltips appearing
 via Edit->Change Preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And once you have stopped playing around with the mouse for entering notes
 you can hide the palettes at the side to give more room for the music display
 (right click and Edit Palette).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Some Common Keyboard Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are a few of the keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Letters 
\family typewriter
a-g
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Numbers 
\family typewriter
0-6
\family default
 are used to refer to the note durations Whole Note ...
 64th Note.
 They insert a duration at the cursor, which you then give a pitch to with
 a note name.
 With the shift key held (or the CapsLock on) 
\family typewriter
0-6
\family default
 edits the duration of the note at the cursor.
 The corresponding Numeric Keypad keys can be used instead.
\end_layout

Some Common Mouse Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are a few of the mouse shortcuts that are commonly used in Denemo (keyboard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Some Common Uses of MIDI in
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI keyboard too can be customized to perform different actions.
 Usually, playing notes adds or edits the score (like hitting note names
 at the pc-keyboard).
 With the sustain pedal pressed chords are generated (the Alt key can be
 used for this too).
 If the interval between the notes played is augmented or diminished it
 is played on a different channel, so that you are alerted to possible pitch
 spelling errors (e.g.
 inputting A-sharp for B-flat).
 By holding down the 
\family typewriter
Ctrl
\family default
 key a score can be checked by playing the notes - the cursor only advances
 if the correct note is played, and the 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
 key can be held down to route the MIDI keyboard straight to the output
 (e.g.
 to check a phrase before playing it in).
 There is a button in the MIDI-in Controls to do this too.
 The Pitch Bend controller can be used to set the range of sharps and flats
 to be used, and the modulation controller can be used to mark sections
 of the music.
 With the MIDI controller set as Input source (Input menu) the duration
 keys create pure durations (notes colored yellow/brown) - you can enter
 as much of the rhythm as you wish, and then play the notes on top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Note and Rest Entry Palettes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On starting Denemo for the very first time a series of palettes are placed
 near the main window with buttons to insert and change notes.
 For more serious use these just waste space, so by right clicking on them
 and choosing Edit this Palette they can be hidden.

\begin_layout Part
Using Denemo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
General Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single
 file (with .denemo suffix).
 This is represented on the screen by a "tab".
 If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music
 in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the
 tab.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One score may contain several movements, which you can move between (
\family typewriter
PgUp
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PgDown
\family default
), insert duplicate, merge and delete with the Movements menu.
 A movement is a continuous piece of music with titles etc.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
When you have more than one movement numbered buttons appear in the score
 titles bar for you to navigate by.
 The first thing on the status bar after any pending accidental is the movement
 number.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically).
 Each Denemo Staff has in turn a Denemo Voice and within the voice are the
 Denemo Objects.
 These can be notes, chords, key changes, time signature changes, voice
 change objects and Denemo Directive objects (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:Denemo-Directives"

\end_inset

).
 The staff properties include things like the number of lines (usually 5)
 the MIDI instrument sound for playback and the amount of space allotted
 in the display for the staff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully
 typeset).
 The position of Denemo Directive objects in the music is marked with a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stick and blob
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and it is accompanied either by a drawing (e.g.
 of a double barline) and/or some text to describe it.
 These are used for most things that are not chords or notes etc: Metronome
 marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples.
 In this example the caesura is a Denemo Directive object marked by the
 stick and blob before the last note and drawn on the staff in an approximate
 representation of its typeset appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/DenemoDirectives.png
	scale 60

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a
 chord, to a staff, to a movement or to the score; in these cases the directive
 can be thought of as an attribute of the object it is attached to.
 In the above example the trill sign is attached to the second note and
 this directive can be inspected and edited using the Object Inspector
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Object-Inspector"

\end_inset

 and Object Editor 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Object-Editor"

\end_inset

.
 Denemo Directives attached to the staff, movement or score can be inspected/edi
ted too, using the relevant editors 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Score-and"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Staff-and"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is more than one voice on a staff it is best displayed on a separate
 staff in the Denemo Display, for ease of editing - the clef is drawn pale
 and there is no timesignature for such extra voices so it is easy to understand
 what is going on.
 The Print Preview window as usual shows the final typeset appearance.
 The clef in this case only affects the display, and any time signature
 or key signature set on it would also only affect the display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Denemo display a cursor shows where the next note will be entered/edited.
 It is red for an over-full bar, blue for appending into an under-full one
 and green when editing (i.e.
 on an already entered object).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular
 action, but also each menu item lets you add the command to a palette,
 enquire what the action does in more detail and set keyboard/mouse shortcuts
 for the action.
 A single keystroke can be set as a shortcut simply by pressing the key
 while the menu item is selected.
 All the extra functionality of menu items can be accessed by right-clicking
 the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself.
 The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.g.
 working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.).
 When you place a command in a palette you can add to an existing palette
 or create a new one - you can choose or create any number of these, free-floati
ng or docked in the main display.
 Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions - often by modifying
 ones that are already there - using the Scheme scripting window.

\begin_layout Standard
The main window has menus and toolbars at the top, and palettes at top and/or
 right hand side.
 Which menus and palettes are shown are selected via the View menu.
 At the bottom is a status line showing which movement you are in and what
 sort of object the cursor is on.
 If there are any MIDI filters that active they will be noted at the right
 in the status bar.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In between is where the music input is displayed, the Denemo Display area.
 When zoomed out you see just the few measures you are working on.
 By dragging the red bar at the bottom of the score upwards you get space
 for more of the music.
 If you have many staffs they may not all fit: you can still scroll the
 display to see several lines of just one or two staffs for instance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can hide staffs in the display if needed using the Staffs->Display Effects
 menu.
 If you need more room you can hide the menus (using the View Menu, shortcut
 Esc key), and arrange a "page view" of the input music - useful when using
 playback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Denemo Display
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The area showing the input music is called the Denemo display.
 It shows staffs and voices and the music interspersed with any Directives.
 The background is grayed out when the focus is elsewhere - click on the
 display to start typing in notes.
 The background is also colored when input from any attached MIDI keyboard
 is not being used for appending/editing the score (as it is by default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default view has a single system stretching off the sides of the window
 - the actual division into lines and pages for the typeset score is done
 in the Print View
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:The-Print-View"

\end_inset

.
 In order to see more of the music on the screen at one time there are three
 changes to the default view you can make.
 Firstly by pressing the Esc key you can switch between three views, two
 of which have no menus taking up space.
 At the bottom of any of these is a red line which can be dragged up to
 split the display into separate lines.
 Using this you can display more bars of music at the expense of seeing
 more staffs for each system (the scrolling allows you to choose which staffs
 to concentrate on).
 As usual, this division into lines has nothing to do with the typeset view
 - widening the window will change the positions of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

line breaks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but have no effect on the final typeset score.
 Actual line breaks in the typeset are managed by the LilyPond typesetter
 and can be overruled by commands in the Directives menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second way of getting to see more of the music is simply to zoom the
 Denemo Display (Ctrl-mouse wheel is best).
 Again this is purely for the input display - you use commands in the Score
 and Directives menu to control the size of staffs, titles etc.
 in the final typeset score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly with large (deep) scores - orchestral scores for instance - you may
 want to hide staffs in the display while you work on others.
 For example, you may want to hide all but the woodwind section.
 The commands for this are in the Staffs menu - you may want to change the
 keyboard shortcuts for navigating staffs (Ctrl-up arrow etc) to invoke
 the staff moves that skip over hidden staffs in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Page View
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-Page-View"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third of the three Denemo display modes that you get with the Esc key
 is called the Page View - it is set up initially with a small zoom factor
 and several systems showing.
 In this view the cursor highlighting has a large green circle around the
 cursor position and the display will animate during playback.
 As the music starts playing the second system down the page the top of
 the page is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turned over
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that, as you reach the bottom of the page your eye can move up to the
 top of the page and follow the music on.
 Once the music starts again at the top of the new page the rest of the
 page is filled in replacing the old page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transition Animation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the problems with moving about a score looking at the input music
 is that it can be difficult to see quickly where the cursor has moved to.
 An even more tricky situation arises when deleting empty measures - often
 the next measure is empty too, so it can appear that nothing has happened,
 it seems the command to delete a measure isn't working.
 What has happened is that another empty measure has moved in from the left
 and the display looks unchanged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid these problems these transitions are animated - the measure coming
 in from the left can be visually seen to shunt in from the side; similarly
 staffs move up from below and the cursor arrives at its new position by
 shrinking onto it.
 All these animation effects (and the page animation of the previous section)

The Main Menubar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Main Menubar has menus for overall control of the program.
 It contains the following submenus:

\begin_layout Subsubsection
File
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 
\series bold
File
\series default
 menu to perform global operations related to storing and retrieving from
 file systems, importing from MusicXML, MIDI, and LilyPond formats, printing
 full score or parts, exporting to MIDI, Ogg, Wav, LilyPond (parts or score),
 PDF and Png formats.
 This is also where you open PDF files containing source material - e.g.
 manuscripts - that you wish to transcribe or proof-reading comments you
 wish to incorporate in your score.
 Another sort of source material can be loaded from here - audio files can
 be loaded for transcribing as well as MIDI files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The New command starts a new score, while New Tab creates an empty score
 while leaving the current score open - a line of tabs appears at the top
 of the display for switching between these.
 Note that you do not have to have multiple scores open to copy and paste
 between scores - opening a new score does not alter the clipboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Open Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Open command (Ctrl-o) opens a Denemo file for editing.
 Open Template opens one of the templates provided with Denemo - this is
 like open except the file once opened becomes untitled, forcing you to
 give it a name on saving.
 Open Example is similar, but here the scores are intended as examples of
 how to do particular things - they can also serve as a place to copy and
 paste from.
 Open Custom Template opens the directory where templates you have created
 with Save Template are stored.
 If you create a template called Default.denemo then the command Open Default
 Template will load it (Ctrl-n).
 Add Staffs and Add Movements take staffs or movements from the Denemo file
 chosen and add them to the current score.
 Open inNew does a combination of New Tab and Open.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Proof Read PDF is for adding proof reading annotations into your score,
 see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Using-a-Proof-Read"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Source for Transcribing allows you to open the source material you
 are transcribing from so that links can be placed in your score to the
 relevant place in that document.
 For more details see the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Transcribing-from-Facsimile"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open recent gives access to a list of recently open scores (you can control
 how many via the preferences).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Source Audio loads an audio file creating empty measures with the audio
 displayed as a series of note-onsets in a line at the top of the display.
 The note-onsets can be dragged to achieve synchronization and tempo-matching
 between the notated bars and the audio.
 You can then add the notes (by ear) and play the two in sync to listen
 for discrepancies.
 This is best explained by the video demos (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "www.denemo.org"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open Source MIDI opens a MIDI file it comes with comprehensive instructions.
 Note that many MIDI files are not suitable for transcription - MIDI describes
 sounds, not notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Navigation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has the commands for moving the cursor around the score, bookmarks,
 and seeking places in the score by content (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Seek
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has a commands to search for rhythmic patterns, note sequences, empty
 measures, next higher/lower note, empty measures ...
 The search facility includes the equivalent of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 shortcut is 
\family typewriter
p
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, too, you invoke editing the Preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NotationMagick submenu is for generating random notes, reflecting, reversing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 
\series bold
Input
\series default
 menu to select external sources (Audio from the Mic input or MIDI) for
 inputting notes to Denemo.
 To use these you should review the settings in Edit->Change Preferences
 MIDI and audio tabs first - change the setting for the backend from

 Extra commands are available (those which not everyone will want) via this
 menu.
 More Commands gives commands shipped with Denemo, while My Commands gives
 ones that you have created locally.
 Note that the extra commands can also be loaded at the menu where you are
 looking for them (you right-click on a menu item, and if there are more
 commands for that menu the More Commands for this Menu item will show),
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Playback
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 
\series bold
Playback
\series default
 menu to listen to the current movement.
 Denemo lets you hear your score, using an internal synthesizer.
 There are commands to play through the all the notes or to observe repeats
 or to play just the chord or notes at the cursor and to play at a shifted
 pitch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Playback uses a pair of marks to decide where to start and stop playing.
 These appear in the display as vertical green and red lines down through
 the notes concerned 
\emph on
when the playback control panel is visible
\emph default
.
 These markers can be moved about by the arrow buttons on either side of
 the play button in the Playback Controls 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Playback-Controls"

\end_inset

 and they are set for you by the Play from Cursor to End, Play Music at
 Cursor, Performance and other commands in this menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Educational
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are games and exercises to help learn notation and to improve your
 recognition of intervals.
 Mostly quite simple, but a more sophisticated example is a command that
 loads Handel's figured bass exercises and allows you to try them out, recording
 your playing and then reporting on any parallel intervals.
 Teachers with an interest in programming can create further games using
 the Scheme window and save them for use by their pupils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the 
\series bold
Help
\series default
 menu to get help using Denemo.
 A list of the shortcuts is available (including any you have set yourself),
 a feature-packed score can be loaded, the excessive help can be tamed,
 and your browser can be launched on the Denemo chat room for asking questions
 directly from other users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
As with all controls and menu items you should hover over the buttons with
 the mouse to get an explanation of what they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The playback starts at the playback start marker (a line in green down the
 score in the Denemo Display) and stops at the playback end marker (a red
 line).
 These lines are not displayed all the time, just once the play has been
 used at least once.
 The start/end markers can be altered with the arrow keys on either side
 of the Play and Record buttons.
 The arrows to the left adjust the playback start, those to the right the
 playback end (hover over the arrows for details).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Playing of sections of the music and looping is possible (including editing
 as the music loops, so that you can listen to different possibilities)
 as well as recording the audio output (mixed with anything you play on
 your MIDI keyboard if you have recording set in the MIDI controls).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The master tempo and volume can be set, which will be overridden by tempo
 and dynamics placed in the music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recording the audio output is also possible as well as real-time slow down
 of the audio playing back (not to be confused with simply setting a slower
 tempo!).
 This last is used when transcribing from audio (See File->Open->Open Source
 Audio).
\end_layout

While playing back the note(s) being played are highlighted - the page view
 mode
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 of the Denemo Display is useful for letting you follow the music in the
 input display.
 You may need to adjust the window size and the division into systems (drag
 the horizontal red divider) to get a good effect from this.
\end_layout

 The buttons at each end change the enharmonic range sharper/flatter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you enter music if you enter an augmented or dimished interval a different

 (Press MIDI record button then start playback).
 Once the playback is stopped anything you have played on the MIDI keyboard
 has been recorded and two buttons Convert and Delete will appear.
 If you press start playback again (without record) the MIDI recording will
 be played back with the score, once you are happy with it then it can be

\begin_layout Standard
The object menu bar gives a set of menus give ordered by the objects (notes,
 staffs, measures ...) that they relate to.
 This division cannot be perfect - some activities could be placed in different

 The advantage of attaching them to a note is that they can be moved around
 as a unit, but the standalone objects are generally easier to drag in the
 Print View should that be needed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Score Properties command gives access to some built-in properties that

There are two sorts of titles.
 Book titles have a separate title page with titles for individual movements
 which can be listed in an automatically generated table of contents.
 Simple titles give a Title and (optionally) movement titles on the same
 page.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comments (

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphic title pages can also be created.
 These can be created by invoking the Inkscape vector graphics editor from
 within Denemo, or using it externally to create the title page.
 A sample title page is included both as an encapsulated postcript (EPS)
 file and as a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file.
 The latter is the form to use for editing the page to suit your needs,
 but it should also be saved as an EPS file as this is the format used to
 include it in the typeset score.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here such things as the overall font size to typeset the score, the rules
 for spacing system, any global transposition, control of page numbering
 etc can be set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beaming rules can be set both in general (invoke Set Beaming Rules without
 a selection) or with exceptions (by invoking with a selection that has
 been beamed manually using the [ and ] commands from the Notes/Rests->Beaming
 menu).
 Use this latter to break up very short notes, for example, that would otherwise
 be beamed together while leaving the longer durations as normal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Movements Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with the Score Menu there may be Denemo Directives attached to the movement
 - e.g titles to be placed at the head of the movement will have a Denemo
 Directive associated with them.
 Other controls that can be applied on a per-movement basis include the
 barline and notehead style, printing of a custos at line ends, the indent
 before the first system (which can also be set on the score-wide basis).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various score checking routines work at movement level from this menu and
 a command to re-bar the movment (or a staff or part of a staff) is also
 here as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Adjust the Measure Lengths
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - this can also be used just to check that the Denemo 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

measures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 correspond with the actual typeset measures (which always follow the durations/
time signatures) or to re-bar a staff or passage or movement if you have
 changed your mind or got out of step.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again there are titles menus for either simple or book titles, and for inserting
 graphics between movements.
 These can be used as decorative separators between movements or to insert
 columns of verses at the end of songs (each song is a separate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

movement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Staff/Voices Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things such as the music crossing to another staff, or Ossia staffs are
 contained here, along with commands for deleting parts of the staff, setting
 up multi-measure rests for a whole staff, muting the staff during playback,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Staff Properties Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This covers such things as the type of staff (e.g.
 Normal Notation, Tablature, Chord Symbols, Fret Diagrams) as well as the
 staff appearance and the playback instrument, instrument name or ambitus
 to be typeset at the start of the staff and more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Add Staff Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows adding staffs to the current movement.
 Piano staffs can be added as well as specialized sorts of staff for dynamics,
 marks (so that they appear once for all layouts), and coulÃ©s (diagonal
 lines positioned between thirds in some music).
 The Add Structured Staff command duplicates the current staff with regard
 to measures and time signature changes, ready for the insertion of music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Voices Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Voices
\emph default
 in Denemo are like staffs but are typeset on the preceding staff to achieve
 single-staff polyphony.
 The Denemo Display is normally set to display any extra voices on a separate
 staff so as to make it easy to work with - the voices have their clef displayed
 in yellow and do not show a key signature as these are supplied by the
 main staff (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primary voice
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Voices will also normally be assigned to voice numbers 1,2,3,4 using the
 Initial Voice commands in this menu (this controls the stemming, slur positions
 etc).
 Voices can change their voice number during the music - the commands for
 this are in the Directives->Typesetter->Voices menu as they insert stem
 change objects in between the notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Display Effects Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here you can choose to hide staffs from the display so that you can see
 distantly placed staffs side by side (e.g.
 in large orchestral scores).
 If you are using this and navigating with the keyboard you will want to
 reset the key shortcuts for staff navigation commands to use variants that
 skip over the hidden staffs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also give more/less room in the display to the staffs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Staff Groupings (Braces) Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The braces at the start of each system are controlled from here.
 The order that you add the braces determines which are outside which.
 The braces are displayed to the left of the staff and can be edited/checked
 there with the mouse.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Clefs Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All sorts of clefs can be selected - the Set Initial and Clef Change commands
 give access to standard clefs.
 The Clef Chooser command lets you set more exotic clefs such as Drum clef
 and even things like the Gregorian chant C clef using the LilyPond syntax
 (e.g.
 vaticana-do3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typeset-only and Display-only clefs enable you to work with a voice which
 is being typeset on a different staff, while keeping the music in the staff
 you wish to see it in or for entering music in a familiar staff which is
 to be typeset in an unfamiliar one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Keys Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting the initial key or a key signature change or to sharpen or flatten
 the key signature at the cursor.
 You can also click on the key signature itself to sharpen/flatten.
 The key signature can be hidden when typeset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Time Signatures Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides basic time signatures various variants (numeric, single digit ...)
 are here.
 There is also beaming control applying just to the current passage (for
 beaming rules for the whole score see the Score->Typesetter menu or for
 the whole movement Movement->Typesetter menu).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Measures Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides commands to insert/delete/navigate/merge/split measures (in one
 or all staffs) this menu includes commands to set an upbeat (anacrusis,
 pickup) measure at the start, or a short measure (e.g.
 during partial first & second time bars).
 First and second time bars markers themselves are to be found in the Directives
->Markings->Spanning menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The whole measure repeat sign is here and some commands to check the measure
 for errors or to widen or narrow the measure in the display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Chords Menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are commands to add notes to a chord either at the cursor, by note
 name or at an interval above the bass.
 Whole chords can have their enharmonic spelling changed up or down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Notes/Rests 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This covers inserting, deleting and modifying notes in pitch, duration and
 appearance and all sorts of things that are attached to note objects such
 as slurs, phrasing slurs, ties, beaming controls, ornaments (trill, turn
 ...), grace notes, articulations (staccato, tenuto ...), fingerings, textual
 markings, cresc.
 and dim.
 (both hairpins and extended cresc.
 --- poco --- a --- poco style) chord symbols (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fakechords
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), figured bass.
 Dynamic markings such as 
\emph on
f 
\emph default
and
\emph on
 p 
\emph default
are separate objects (see Directives->Markings->Dynamics).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also here is the tuplet menu, for groups of notes that have a duration that
 is a fraction of the written duration, such as triplets.
 These actually insert tuplet start and end objects, before and after the
 notes concerned so, strictly speaking they should come in a separate miscellane
ous objects category.
 As usual, the most useful commands have shortcuts already - Tab starts/stops
 a triplet alternately (so you can press it once, enter the notes and press
 it again to finish the triplet).
 And Keypad 7, Keypad 7 turns the note entered into a triplet of notes (with
 Control as well they are slurred).
 This is set as a two-key shortcut so that you can type it in as a triplet
 rhythm: e.g.
 the three keypresses 4, KP_7, KP_7 will give a triplet of three 1/16th
 notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Append/Edit Note Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So called because in appending position the note names a, b, c ...
 append a note while when the cursor is on an note it edits the note to
 have the note-name indicated.
 The other note edit commands here are shifting up and down an octave, sharpenin
g or flattening.
 Cautionary and reminder accidentals are here too - to set the style of
 accidentals (e.g.
 if they are repeated in various circumstances) see the Score->Typesetter
 menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Note Insertion Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This menu has commands for inserting notes at (i.e.
 before the object at) the cursor position.
 The double key press A, A inserts the note A in the prevailing duration
 (more commonly people press a duration key 0, 1, ...
 followed by a note name).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you enter a note and then sharpen you will hear both note and sharpened
 note - to avoid this use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sharpen Next Note
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 command (likewise for flatten, use twice for double-sharp,flat) the default
 key presses are '=' and '-' for these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Append/Insert Duration Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So called because the commands 0, 1, 2 ...
 append a note when the cursor is in the appending position or enter a note
 if the cursor is on an object.
 If you have a MIDI keyboard (and it is designated in the preferences under
 the MIDI tab) then the note will be purely rhythmic (yellow/brown) playing
 a pitch will turn it into a real note.
 Here is the command for entering a snippet (which can be a complete rhythmic
 pattern) as well as Breve and Longa for early music.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also a set of comands for appending notes which will be slurred
 from previous notes (Control-0, etc) which means that you can enter slurs
 as you enter the rhythm of a bar without extra key presses (which would
 otherwise break the rhythm of your entry).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Edit Duration Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the commands for changing the duration of the note/rest/chord at
 the cursor as well as doubling or dividing the note at the cursor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides commands for dotting notes there are commands for turning the note
 at the cursor into a dotted rhythm of two notes and for entering a dotted
 rhythm with two key presses (so as to keep in rhythm - e.g.
 3, KP_9 gives dotted 1/8 note, 1/16th note, and the corresponding slurred
 one with Control).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Rest Insertion Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides inserting rests (Alt-0 etc) you can insert non-printing rests (where
 voices are silent) and move rests out of the way in polyphonic situations
 where LilyPond doesn't do what you want.
 Whole measure rests and multi-measure rests are here too with control over
 their numbering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Select Duration Submenu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands to explicitly set the prevailing duration are here (though
 usually this is set by inserting a duration) and, more importantly the
 command to select a snippet as the prevailing duration (Shift+ Space) after
 which entered notes follow the pattern of the snippet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Directives
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This covers all the things that aren't notes but sit in between them.
 The most useful for regular music notation are barlines, dynamic markings,
 tempo marks, rehearsal marks etc in the Markings submenu.
 There is an enormous collection of stuff here though.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One general feature is the Conditional Directives which can be used to restrict
 a directive to a particular type of score layout (e.g.
 only to be used when printing a part, or a full score).
 This can be used, for example, to prevent a cue being printed on the full
 score (as it is only relevant when printing the part).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Lyrics 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add lyrics to a staff move the cursor onto the staff and choose Add Lyric

 You need to have the Lyrics View visible (see View menu).
 Each verse has a separate tab, with the current verse for the current staff
 being visible at any one time.

Edit Lyric at Cursor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Ctrl-l, Ctrl-l) which finds the place in the lyrics corresponding to the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palettes are collections of commands arranged as a column, row or grid of
 buttons either in a separate window or docked in the Main Window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The buttons are not just for mouse users - palette buttons can be executed
 by clicking with the mouse or typing 
\family typewriter
p
\family default
 followed by (part of) the label of the button followed by the 
\family typewriter
Enter 
\emph on

 The entry for keying in a palette label looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
At the top is the name of the palette that is active, in this case the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 palette.
 You can switch to a different palette with TAB - the palette does not have
 to be displayed on the screen, but if you type a label that does not exist
 it will be shown to remind you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make full use of the keyboard for executing commands from your palettes
 you should edit the labels so that they are easy to type & memorable.
 Put the shorter ones first as you do not need to type all of the label,
 just enough to select the needed button.
 Right-clicking on a palette button allows you to edit the button, changing
 the label or tooltip, duplicating the button (e.g.
 to create an edited version of its script) and more, as in the following
 popup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename images/PaletteMenu.png
	scale 60

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also edit the palette itself by right clicking on any button and
 choosing the Edit this Palette submenu (shown open above).
 You can make the palette fill up horizontally or vertically and restrict
 the number of columns/rows respectively.
 You can dock/undock palettes as well and hide palettes that are not needed
 (you can also hide undocked palettes by dismissing their window).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the View menu you can select a palettes of commands to display or show
 all the palettes and then hide the ones you don't want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should make palettes your best friend - when you find a command in the
 menu system that you need right click on it and choose Add to Palette.
 This way you will build up one or more collections of commands that you
 need.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Palette buttons can also be created directly from objects so that you can
 create more of them in your score; if you run Help->Open Feature Packed
 Score and find the type of object or attribute you need there then you
 can run the Object Editor on it and create a palette button for installing
 the same thing in your own score.
 See the Object Editor

\begin_layout Standard
In the View menu you can show the Command Center.
 This has a list of all the Denemo commands, hidden or not, with their shortcut(
s).
 The box at the top left gives full details of the currently selected command
 and its location in the menu system.
 Below that is a search box for finding any command you need by matching
 words in its description or label.
 By choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fuzzy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you will make the search less strict - one word could be missing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search starts as you type in the first letter of any key words you want,
 so check after each letter to see if you have found the command you need.
 To search for further commands matching your keywords press the arrow next
 to the search box.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command center is also where you can set one-key shortcuts such as 
\family typewriter

 You can also look up which command responds to a given shortcut, and execute
 the selected command here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition you can save and load whole sets of shortcuts and commands.
 If you have upgraded your version of Denemo and you have elected to keep

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Music snippets are short selections from a voice which can be stored on
 the Snippet tool bar.
 They have two main uses: they can act as a repository of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

motifs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which can be inserted (
\family typewriter
Ctrl-Space
\family default
) at the cursor, and they can be used as an extension to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

prevailing duration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 idea.
 In the second use, by selecting a snippet as you enter pitches the durations
 are assigned from the next step in the snippet.
 The first case is especially useful when entering a complex rhythm which
 is repeated many times in the piece.
 In all cases the snippet can contain all sorts of attributes and markings,
 slurs, beaming indications, ornaments etc, and these will then all be entered
 with a single keypress or as you add pitches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Details
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Snippet tool bar has only one button initially: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Create
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This button lets you create a snippet from the current selection.
 The selection should be a contiguous selection of objects in a single voice.
 Once created the snippet appears on the snippet tool bar as a button -
 the label is generated to indicate the content, and this label can be further
 edited by clicking on the button and choosing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edit Label
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Other options on clicking a snippet button are to insert the snippet, to
 select the snippet (in which case as you enter pitches they follow the
 rhythm of the snippet, including any slurs, trills, or articulations that
 are in the snippet) etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Ctrl-Space 
\family default
inserts the selected snippet or (if none is selected) inserts the snippet
 that you specify by number.
 
\family typewriter
Shift-Space
\family default
 selects the next snippet (or first if none selected), to unselect a snippet
 choose a duration (0, 1...) to be used instead for entering pitches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the insertion case, you may have two or three snippets that apply to
 a given score - special bits of text that appear over notes for example
 - and you can insert them using 
\family typewriter
Ctrl-Space
\family default
, 1 (or 2 or 3 ...) as needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the pattern-following case you will be selecting snippets using

The mouse scroll wheel enables vertical panning and with Shift horizontal
 panning.
 With Control pressed you can zoom the view, which is very important for
 re-shaping slurs.
 Right click for help with tweaking beam angles, slurs etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right clicking in a blank area of the typeset view (normal cursor) gives
 a menu providing help and allowing you to typeset with the control points
 for curves and the location points of objects marked as red dots and crosses.
 Be sure to turn off these red dots and crosses before printing or creating
 a customized score layout, as they are embedded in the score and will print.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Editing in the Print View - WYSIWYG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clicking on the typeset score can locate the place in the Denemo Display
 belonging to it.
 For this to work look for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pointer as you move the mouse over the typeset score.
 Use a big enough zoom factor to make this easy.
 The hand pointer indicates a place where if you click the Denemo Cursor
 will move to the Denemo Object that belongs to that feature.
 The navigation works for noteheads, slurs, ties and various marks - some
 other things such as lyrics can't be used to navigate - choose the note
 that the lyrics underlie to find the right place in the Denemo Display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can actually edit your input music using the mouse on the Print View
 window - something referred to as what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG),
 which is how the conventional music editors work all the time.
 But in doing this it will help if you keep in mind that the Denemo program
 does not know anything about what LilyPond has actually drawn in the Print
 View window - Denemo is just displaying the PDF file that LilyPond has
 created.
 The PDF file 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 contain links - the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hand
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pointer - so it does 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about where things are in the Denemo Display, but not the other way round.
 This means that to use wysiwyg features you have to tell Denemo more about
 what you are doing than you would expect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Editing Positions and Padding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right clicking on some objects in this pane allows you to edit them.Use this
 for the occasions when LilyPond has positioned things badly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The editing procedures depend on whether the object is attached to a note
 or appears between the notes in the Denemo Display.
 Depending on the object you can drag it to a better position or change
 whether it appears above or below the note its attached to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also select an amount of padding to apply to some objects so that
 they keep their distance from other items in the score.
 Adjusting the padding is generally a better way of indicating that something
 is too close to something else, since other objects will move away from
 it as needed and if you later edit the score it will behave more intelligently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Re-shaping Slurs and Ties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slurs and beaming can also be altered here.
 When you right-click on a slur or tie the Denemo Cursor moves to the note
 where the slur starts and you are offered the chance to edit the shape
 of the curve.
 Choose a large zoom factor before you begin, and turn on the control points
 (red dots and crosses) as described 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:Mouse-Controls"

\end_inset

above.
 Then right click on the curve and choose Edit Shape.
 You have to click on the reference point first - this is on the center-line
 of the staff at the horizontal position of the notehead where the curve
 starts - this is marked with a red dot.
 Then you click and drag on the four 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

control-points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that define the shape of the curve.
 Once the shape looks good, right click in a blank area and click Apply.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With practice you can skip the use of the red dots and crosses as you can
 guess where they would be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adding Line or Page Breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Page or line breaks added by right-clicking on a note at a barline and choosing
 from the menu.
 This works because right-click positions the Denemo Cursor at the note
 and then the page or line break command is run just as if you were working
 directly in the Denemo Display.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Object Inspector is shown by clicking View->Object Inspector, or just
 double-clicking on an object in the Denemo Display.
 It gives comprehensive information about the object at the cursor.
 This includes directives like ornaments, dynamic markings, fingerings that
 may be attached to the object.
 For objects like notes and rests which start at a particular musical moment
 it also describes at what moment in the measure the note begins and what
 its duration is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Object Inspector is sensitive to which note of a chord the cursor is
 on, so that things like fingerings (which can vary from note to note within
 a chord) are displayed individually as you move the cursor up and down
 a chord.
 You can step through the notes of a chord using the button marked 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 which will work upwards through the notes before wrapping round to start
 at the lowest note.
\end_layout

that is you cannot interact with Denemo outside of the editor until you
 have dismissed it.
 To warn you of this the pointer turns to an X if you try to interact with
 the Denemo Input Display when the Object Editor is still open.
 Buttons are provided to move on to editing the next (or previous) object.
 For each Denemo Directive (either standalone or attached to the chord or
 note) there is a button 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edit command: <
\emph on
name of command
\emph default
>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - the tooltip of this button gives the help text of the command that created
 it.
 This button will run the command in edit mode.
 There are also buttons to do a low-level edit (Advanced) or to delete the
 directive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with the Object Inspector the Object Editor is sensitive to the cursor
 height, with the same navigation control to move through the notes of a
 chord so as to allow editing the detail of each note.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Creating Palette Buttons for Objects and Properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Object Editor also has buttons for creating Palette Buttons for the
 Denemo Directive that it edits.
 There are two of these: one button would run the command that created the
 attribute/object the other will instantiate a duplicate - a clone - of
 the attribute/object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Create Button for Command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This creates a palette button to run the command that created the Denemo
 Directive you have Object Editor open on.
 You are asked which palette you want to place the button in, and can create
 a new, custom, palette at that stage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if you use this on the Arranger attribute of a score you will
 get a button that runs the command Arranger (which is found in Score->Titles...).
 That button would then ask you to fill in the name of the arranger.
 Compare this with the next button, where you will create a button that
 will install a clone of Arranger attribute that you have on this score
 - the arranger will be already filled in, saving you having to enter your
 own name each time you create a new score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Create Button for Clone
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This creates a button which when clicked will insert a duplicate of the
 Denemo Directive that the Object Editor is looking at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that for any specific attribute you want to re-use you can create
 a button that will install exactly that Denemo Directive at the cursor.
 So, even if you do not know how a particular effect was generated, you
 can create a palette button to use the effect in your own score.
 The Open->Open Example scores provide useful examples of things you may
 need.
 See the section on Palettes
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Palettes"

\end_inset

 for more about palettes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This button is particularly useful for things like your copyright notice
 which stays the same from score to score - you just need a clone to install
 on a new score.

This tab affects the sounds you will hear via a connected audio system.
 The first section is for feedback when entering music.
 If you are looking at a source manuscript while entering rhythms or notes
 you will not want to look across at the input display to check that you
 are still entering at the right part of the bar.
 The sound effect that tells you a new bar is beginning is set via the first
 field - it is one of the drum effects available in the default Denemo soundfont
, number 72, change this to 0 to turn it off, or other values for a more
 discrete sound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are settings for controlling the pitch spelling for MIDI in - augmented
 and diminished intervals switch to this channel; if you hear this on an
 interval that was not supposed to be augmented or diminished you are alerted
 that you have the enharmonic range wrongly set for the piece.
 You can set this to the instrument in use to avoid the effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dynamic Compression affects the volume at which notes are played back
 as you enter them from a MIDI keyboard - by compressing 100% you avoid
 meaningless variations in volume - you are only entering notes, not giving
 a moving performance, after all! Without this you will find some notes
 are too quiet to be noticed and will think the note wasn't registered.
 Note that the value 99 for dynamic compression is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 value, it gives a slight after-touch effect, useful for percussive instruments
 (disatrous for organs!) to avoid the clipped sound when the note terminates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Audio Backend section changes where Denemo tries to send the output
 sounds to - it can be difficult to match up the options to the hardware

 After checking carefully that you have got speakers attached and that they

Score and Movement Button Bars
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The View->Titles, Buttons etc checkbox makes two horizontal button bars
 visible (if they have buttons on them).
 What the buttons show are titles/composer etc for the score and for the
 current movement.
 The score button bar holds the movement indicator buttons for scores that
 have several movements - you can click on one of these to move quickly
 to a different movement.
 In addition other score-wide settings create buttons on the score titles
 bar and movement wide settings on the movement titles bar.
 The menu items that populate these are under Score->Titles etc., and Movement->T
itles etc and other menus.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Style, Layout, Titling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section covers where to find commands for titles, page numbering, table
 of contents, critical commentary, page size and so on.
 The commands for stylistic directives are in the Score->Typesetter or Movements
->Typesetter menus.
 Here you find commands to set the accidental style (when should accidentals
 be repeated?) and bar numbering styles, Rehearsal Mark style, page numbering
 conventions, the fonts to use for the various elements of the score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this directory there are commands to control the number of systems per
 page or bars per system - these would only be needed in exceptional circumstanc

 There are also commands to control how systems are laid out on the page,
 and on the last page (the Ragged * commands), and to control the margins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notehead style for the whole score is here (see the Notes/Rests->Notehead
 menu for individual notes) and a command for creating a custom barline
 style which can then be used in the score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command to instruct the typesetter to transpose the entire score is
 here - two flavors, a quick text-based one or one that allows you to specify
 the transposition you require by setting the pitches of two notes (from

name "sub:Beaming"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands to control beaming are available for individual notes, whole passages
 of notes and entire scores.
 Mostly the default beaming will be what you want.
 An exception is the beaming in 3/4 time which can look like 6/8 when beamed
 in the traditional manner.
 Use Object Menu->Time Signature->Beam at Half Measure to alter the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individual beam control commands are located in Notes/Rests->Beaming.
 The start/stop beam shortcuts are usually [ and ].
 Other commands include providing partial breaks in the beaming and stopping
 beaming on a note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting beaming for the whole score can be done using ObjectMenu->Score->Typeset
ter->Set Beaming Rules.
 Either the general rule can be given, or Beam Exceptions can be set from
 the selection.
 To use the latter, set up a measure or measures with the beaming manually
 set using the Individual beam controls and then select the passage and
 invoke Set Beaming Rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting beaming for a passage can be done with ObjectMenu->Time Signatures->Set
 Beaming Rule.
 In addition, at a time signature change a beaming rule can be set using
 ObjectMenu->Time Signatures->Time Signature with Beaming Rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After automatic beaming has been turned off use ObjectMenu->Directives->Typesett
er->Start Beaming to insert a directive re-starting automatic beaming at
 the cursor.
 The Cadenza On/Off commands turn on/off automatic beaming (as well as the
 timing control).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Barlines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The important thing to know about barlines in Denemo is that they are not
 just graphical marks on paper - e.g.
 you cannot put a repeat end barline followed by a repeat start barline
 and expect both to print - instead you must use a repeat-end-start barline.
 This is because you are telling Denemo about the music, not about how to
 draw it - the repeat-end-start barline is drawn completely differently
 if it occurs at the end of a line, for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful thing to understand is that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

barlines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that appear in the Denemo display are not really barlines at all, just
 a convenient breaking up of the music into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chunks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Normally, of course, you will use one chunk per measure so they 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 correspond with the typeset barlines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a relationship between line/page breaks and barlines: you cannot
 have line/page breaks at any point in the music, there must be a barline
 there.
 However this can be a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 barline, so that option is in the menu too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One curious consequence of this is what happens if you contrive to input
 notes that are timed so that a note is always playing at every barline;
 normally you use tied notes for this, but if (by mistake) you leave one
 bar short in duration you can find that none of the following typeset bars
 start with a note, and the result is that the line cannot be broken - it
 extends off the right hand side of the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ties and Slurs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
...
 and phrasing slurs.
 It is important to distinguish ties from slurs since they often look the
 same in the typeset music, but in some circumstances they are typeset different
ly - so you may think the music looks ok, and later after some editing,
 it looks wrong - you have hit a situation where the typesetting distinguishes
 the two.
 To help with this Denemo shows distinguishes slurs with little green and
 red markers for the start/end, while the ties are heavier horizontal curves.
 If you import music from other notation programs they often confuse slurs
 and ties, so a command to fix these is in the Notes/Rests->Tied Notes menu.
 (In the unusual case of slurred notes of the same pitch - e.g.
 open string/stopped note on a violin - you would have to correct the error
 by hand).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also in this menu are commands to tie individual notes in chords, to control
 the direction (up/down) of ties and to adjust the shape of ties which can
 be very tricky to position nicely in tight situations.
 Ties at repeats, where the tie goes to/comes from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nothing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, are here too;they are called Laissez Vibrer and Repeat Tie.
 (Laissez Vibrer has two uses, of course, but it is the same symbol).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands for slurs are in the Notes/Rests->Slurs menu.
 The most useful have the shortcuts 7,8,9 to slur from the current note
 to the next note, to extend the slur and to reduce it.
 There are also commands to turn on/off a slur start or slur end, and these
 are also in the right-click menu on the notes in the Denemo Display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When entering rhythms with the numeric keypad the slurs can be added without
 breaking rhythm by using the control key with the rhythm.
 So, for example, Ctrl-3 enters a 1/8 duration slurring from the previous
 note, or extending the slur.
 And Control keypad 9 (Ctrl-KP_9) creates a slurred dotted rhythm (corresponding
 to keypad 9 which creates a dotted rhythm based on the last entered duration)
 and similarly Ctrl-KP_7,Ctrl-KP_7 for entering a slurred triplet based
 on the current duration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phrasing slurs are slurs over the top of ordinary slurs, used in Romantic
 music and later.
 The display just shows where they start and end, the typesetter allows
 only one level of nesting slurs as that is all that is used in music.
 More would require a non-printing voice carrying the extra layers of slurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Triplets and Friends
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Collectively called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tuplets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 these are handled in Denemo by two markers, one beginning the tuplet which
 holds the timing change and the other a simple end tuplet marker.
 The Denemo Display only knows how to display tuplets that start and end
 in the same bar, but the typesetter is not restricted in that way.
 You can stop and re-start the tuplets at measure breaks so that the Denemo
 Display understands what you mean, and control the placement of tuplet
 numbering and tuplet brackets using the Tuplet Brackets and Tuplet Numbering
 commands in the same menu.
 The typeset can also cope with nested tuplets perfectly well, though the
 Denemo Display will be strange.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are specific commands for the more common tuplets, and arbitrary tuplets
 can be started using the Arbitrary Tuplet command - you give the numbers
 to denote the fraction that the timing is changing by (e.g.
 triplets are 2/3 of the duration written so you give 2,3).
 If you wanted 7 notes in the time of 4 you would give 4, 7 so that the
 durations changed by 4/7, after seven 1/8-notes you would have the equivalent
 of 4 1/8-notes duration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Grace Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both appogiature and acciacature are supported, as well as inserting pairs
 of beamed grace notes (other amounts of grace notes should be manually

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Grace Notes present a peculiar problem to the LilyPond typesetter that Denemo
 uses.
 As they do not have any duration it gets into difficulties if there are
 other things (such as time signatures, double bars etc) going on at the
 same time.
 The problem arises when other parts are also sounding and they don't have
 the same grace notes.
 There is a command in Denemo to work around this by installing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grace note hints
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 - these are dummy non-printing grace notes in the other parts.
 This is done automatically by the Check Score routine, so normally you
 don't have to run it yourself, but it is in the Notes/Rests->Grace Notes
 menu.
 It is good to be aware of this however, as you will see these pale yellow
 rests that declare themselves to be grace notes in the input music display
 sometimes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 the Denemo Display as separate objects before the note they decorate.
 Besides all the standard ornaments, there are commands to stack accidental
 signs above/below ornaments and to create customized ornaments, drawn using
 an external vector graphics editor.
 One set of custom-built ornaments for French harpsichord ornaments is provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notes/Rests->Markings->Dynamics for dynamic spanners (cresc.

 Directives->Markings->Dynamics (shortcut Ctrl-d) for dynamic marks (
\emph on
p, sfz etc) 
\emph default
they appear as objects in the Denemo Display just before the note they relate
 to.
 These dynamics affect both typeset and playback.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some circumstances it is desirable to place dynamics in a separate 
\emph on
Dynamics Staff.
 
\emph default
This is often the case for the dynamics centered between piano staffs; it
 ensure that hairpins align with each other and that other dynamic markings
 are placed consistently.
 It also allows for positioning of dynamics markings other than directly
 on notes - they can be placed at slightly later or earlier times.
 To do this notes of shorter duration are put in the dynamics staff and
 the dynamic markings are attached to them.
 The notes are just dummy notes to indicate the timing of the onset of the
 dynamic attached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tempo Markings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Directives->Markings->Tempi and Metronome Marks allows insertion of a tempo

\begin_layout Standard
The most general command is Directives->Markings->Multi-line Text and Music.
 As the name implies, you can not only insert simple text but also control
 the italic, bold, superscript, font-size etc, as well as inserting actual
 notated music, fret-diagrams in the sentences.
 These work by inserting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, that is the text is interspersed with 
\backslash
bold, 
\backslash
italic etc to indicate what appearance is desired.
 A Preview button is provided so that you can see the effect of the markup.
 Buttons are provided to create effects such as bold, italic and the insertion
 of note names (so that things like B-minor in a title will transpose when
 the score is transposed) - these buttons remember the LilyPond markup language
 for you, so you don't need to look it up.
 There are also commands to insert fret diagrams etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Text Spanning 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Directives->Markings->Spanning menu are commands that cause markings
 that span a passage of music, such as Cadenza and Piano Sustain pedal marks,
 ottava markings, and extended trill marks.
 Here also are 1st and 2nd (and nth) time bars, with shortcuts r,1 for starting
 a first time bar, r,2 starting a second time bar and r,e for ending either.
 The Nth time bar can be used to hold any text needed (i.e.
 use this for a first time bar if the indication should be other that 1.).

\begin_layout Standard
You can set the keyboard shortcut for a command just by pressing the desired
 key while the menu item is selected.
 You can right click on the menu item and choose Open Command Center to
 set a two-key keyboard shortcut.
 This means that you can tailor Denemo to allow you to use your preferred
 method of entering notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the
 keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically
 using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you
 need you can consult the menu system to find out.
 This method is good for touch typists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via
 a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With all methods of note entry a measure start sound will be heard when
 your note entry has moved to a new measure, which means you do not have
 to look up to know that you have started a new measure as expected.
 This measure start sound can be set to 0 in the preferences if unwanted.

\begin_layout Subsection
Playing Notes into Denemo - MIDI
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Playing-Notes-into"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo can take pitches directly from MIDI input.
 Select Input->Midi Input.
 The control panel allows you to choose the enharmonic range, the default
 centers around the initial key signature (e.g.
 E-flat to G-sharp for C-major).
 If you enter a diminished or augmented interval the note will be played
 in a separate MIDI channel which can be used to alert you to pitch-spelling
 mistakes (e.g.
 entering A-flat when G-sharp was meant, you will get a lot more augmented
 and dimished intervals if you have the enharmonic range set wrongly for
 your piece).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to use the MIDI keyboard is enter the music firstly as pure
 rhythms using the pc-keyboard, ignoring the note names.
 The durations show as yellow/brown notes.
 Each duration makes a distinctive sound as you enter the durations.
 As you start each measure a sound is made so that you can keep your eyes
 on the score you are copying from, without needing to look up and check
 that you haven't miss-typed.
 If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm
 rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have entered the rhythms for one or more measures you can play
 the notes via MIDI - the cursor automatically goes to the start of the
 rhythms you have entered.
 As you play notes in via MIDI they give their pitches to the rhythm you
 have notated.
 By this means you can enter a piece of music in the time taken to play
 it twice - once to give the rhythm and once to give the pitches.
 If the piece modulates strongly you may need to shift the set of accidentals
 used to match the score, the pitch spelling facility will alert you to
 this.
 (If entering pitches via a mic you need to navigate to the start point,
 but this isn't needed for MIDI in).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under Input->MIDI are various "MIDI filters" that allow you to control how
 the MIDI input is used: with none active the behavior is as if you had
 entered the notes using the pc-keyboard, but with the following advantages
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The octave, accidental and note name are all entered in one press of the
 MIDI key.
 The cursor automatically advances so you can continue to play in notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The duration keys enter the yellow/brown duration-only notes, when you play
 a MIDI key the cursor automatically moves to the first of these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Holding down the 
\family typewriter
Alt
\family default
 key (or sustain pedal) lets you enter chords.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 The cursor only advances if the note played is the one at the cursor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Holding down the 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
 key lets you listen to the MIDI keyboard without affecting the score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The problem of entering the wrong enharmonic is largely avoided by Denemo's
 simple pitch-spelling strategy.
 The more extreme intervals are played in a separate MIDI channel so that
 if, for example you enter F - A-sharp it sounds quite distinct from F -
 B-flat.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Numeric Keypad
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of keys for entering numerical data that appear on full-sized keyboards
 make a very useful tool for entering rhythms.
 Even if you use a laptop without such a numeric keypad it is worth the
 5 or 6 dollars/euros/pounds that a separate USB keyboard costs nowadays
 - it can be blu-tacked to your MIDI controller for easy access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default key shortcuts for the numeric keypad are illustrated here:
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I have actually stuck labels with the most used durations and over-drawn
 an indication of the others.
 (Keys 5 and 6 do the1/32 and 1/64th notes).
 The keypad 7 does triplets with a double press (so that it makes three
 presses for a triplet, e.g.
 Key 4, Key 7, Key 7 for a triplet of 1/16th notes).
 The dotted rhythm 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dottifies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the current note whatever its duration is.
 Likewise the grace note key turns the current note into a grace note and
 the tie key turns tied status off/on for the current note.
 Keypad 8 fills the rest of the bar with the current note or rest, while
 Enter duplicates the current bar.
 The enharmonic shifts can be pressed repeatedly to shift the set of accidentals
 to be used sharp-wise of flat-wise, subsequent notes played in will be
 taken from the new set, which is indicated on the status bar.
 The duration keys, triplet key and dottify key can all be used with the
 Control modifier to slur from the previous note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this arrangement you can play in the rhythm of a piece in musical time
 and then play once more with the MIDI keyboard to add the notes (chords
 require the Alt key or foot pedal).
 Before you are practiced in this use of the numeric keypad it is a good
 idea to do just a bar or two, or a line or two at a time, so as not to
 lose your place.

Some computers don't respect the numeric keypad's keys - confusing the Enter

 Try the numlock key to see if you can persuade it to take you seriously,
 or look into any key-mapping facility there may be with the machine.
 And, beware! a separate standalone numeric keypad might seem like a good
 idea but in fact they are a nuisance, besides being more expensive, as
 they have things like a 000 key which emits three keypresses at your peril!

Playing Notes into Denemo - Audio (Soundcard Mic Input)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of
 the computer; it doesn't attempt to guess the rhythm - such systems do
 not work well - but you will find that playing the notes in time will help
 you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience
 rather than a chore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the
 note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note.
 If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be
 much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals
 at the computer keyboard.
 Using the headphones-out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off"
 interfering with the pitch detection.
 Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification - it is
 worth getting the level right before you begin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you select the Input->Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition
 window pops up.
 While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive
 to pitches heard via the microphone input.
 The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will
 be entered into the score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways of using the pitch entry - Overlay mode (default) and
 Insert mode.
 The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure
 in the prevailing rhythm - the mode is set to Insert for this.
 The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the
 pitches you sound.
 There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical
 instrument tuner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor.
 If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed
 note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected.
 You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them
 altogether if you want to start over in a measure.
 If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the
 cursor position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when
 you enter the given pitch - you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation
 to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection
 less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic
 instrument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard
 into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into
 the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone,
 in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument
 to get reliable detection.
 Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones.
 To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and
 put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in â the notes should
 all turn blue if you have perfect detection.
 It is worth while getting perfect detection â more than one or two miss-detects
 per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches
 you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes.
 You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting
 the rhythm.
 In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete
 it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn't involve entering
 the rhythm separately.
 For this select Input->Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays
 on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up.
 With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm.
 The same applies if you have MIDI - by choosing a rhythm (e.g.
 half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the
 pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.

\begin_layout Subsection
Using the Denemo From the PC keyboard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Note Entry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default keyboard shortcuts appends a note when you type a number key
 
\family typewriter
0-6
\family default
 with the pitch taken from the cursor height and inserts a note when pressing
 a letter key 
\family typewriter
a-g
\family default
.
 This provides one way of entering notes - move the cursor up or down to
 the note position and press a number key for the duration.
 If the note is to be out-of-key then the 
\family typewriter
equal 
\family default
or 
\family typewriter
minus 
\family default
key can be used to sharpen/double-sharpen/flatten/double-flatten the next
 note.
 This method of note entry is probably not the most efficient however: in
 the Input->PC Keyboard menu you can choose to make the number keys change
 the prevailing duration without entering a note.
 With that setting you can use the note names to append notes to the bar
 only pressing the number keys if the duration changes.
 The duration can be dotted/double dotted with the period key, and the octave
 adjusted with comma (for down) or apostrophe (for up).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mixed mouse and keyboard strategies are possible too.
 For example with one hand changing the prevailing duration via the keyboard
 the other can click on the Insert Note buttons in the Note Insertion palette.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Chord Entry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard keybinding for entering a note in a chord is the 
\family typewriter
Insert
\family default
 key, 
\family typewriter
Ctrl-Insert
\family default
 or
\family typewriter
 Del
\family default
,
\family typewriter
Del
\family default
 deletes.
 The is inserted at the cursor height, use 
\family typewriter
-
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
+
\family default
 to flatten/sharpen the note before you enter it (avoiding hearing both
 notes if you flatten/sharpen afterwards).
 There are also commands to enter a named note 
\family typewriter
Alt-a
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Alt-b
\family default
...
 are the standard shortcuts for this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Editing Music
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When not appending music, the letter keys change the note at the cursor
 to that named note.
 You need to use the 
\family typewriter
shift
\family default
 key to insert a new note.
 So 
\family typewriter
Shift-a
\family default
,
\family typewriter
Shift-a
\family default
 inserts the note A etc.
 Plain 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
 edits the note at the cursor to be an A.
 Likewise with the numeric keypad the 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
 key can be used to edit a note duration, while the plain number keys insert
 the duration of the note at the cursor.
 (If you do not have a numeric keypad, you have to use the number keys -
 best to plug in an additional USB keyboard with numeric keypad, they are
 very cheap nowadays).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rests are entered with 
\family typewriter
Alt-0 Alt-1 ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Spacer rests (that is non-printing rests as seen in keyboard polyphony)
 have shortcuts too 
\family typewriter
Mod4-0
\family default
 etc, where 
\family typewriter
Mod4
\family default
 is the key with a flag on it.
 However, on Windows machines you will need to reclaim the 
\family typewriter
Windows
\family default
 Mod-4 key from Microsoft or re-define the shortcuts, e.g.
 to 
\family typewriter
Shift-Alt-0
\family default
 etc or 
\family typewriter
Ctrl-Alt-0
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Caps Lock 
\family default
can be a nuisance - you will sometimes have it turned on accidentally and
 wonder why keypress are not working.
 You 
\emph on
can 
\emph default
use it to achieve Shift-A, Shift-B ...
 but it is probably best left alone.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a PDF of music you wish to transcribe with Denemo you can display
 it within Denemo and create links between the source material and your
 transcrition.
 This means that when you later review your work you can quickly locate
 which point in the original manuscript belongs to which point in your transcrip
tion.
 In the screenshot the Print View window is shown on the left with the facsimile
 on the right.
 The Print View is a Custom Layout showing the chords both as notation and
 as chord symbols (as well as the original figures).
 The blue marker shows the position of the link that was clicked on to open
 the facsimile at the right place.
 Note that the piece is also being typeset in a different key - that is
 just another aspect of this custom layout.
 Everything - including the chord symbols are automatically adjusted.

Select the File->Open menu and the item Open a Source for Transcribing.
 Select the PDF containing the music to be transcribed from.
 The PDF is opened in a Source View window.
 Right-click in this window at the point that your transcription will start.
 This will create a link - a Denemo Directive Object - in your score at
 the Denemo cursor position, shown as arrow icon.
 If you later use a right-click on this Denemo Directive the source file
 will be re-opened with the blue highlight marker on that point in the score.
 (Depending on the position of the top of the page you may need to scroll
 the Source View window up or down to bring it into view).
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you send the PDF output of your score to someone to proof-read they can
 make PDF annotations to it.
 In the File->Open menu choose Open Proof Read PDF to open a proof-read
 PDF.
 It will open at the first annotation, and, by clicking on the note the
 annotation applies to, the annotation is transferred as a comment into
 the score before the note chosen.
 When you have done all the annotations on the first page advance to the
 next page with annotations using the button "Next".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are limitations - the PDF must be created from your score with point-and-c
lick (the default) and you must not alter the score in a way that would
 invalidate the point-and-click.
 (Basically, don't edit again until the proof-reading is done, always good
 practice!) Also, enter the annotations in order from the start and don't
 edit before you have entered all the annotations, as this could invalidate
 the point-and-click.

\begin_layout Section
Score Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo provides different ways to set up scores: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create template with the special name "default.denemo".
 If this is placed at the top level of your templates directory (that is
 ~/.denemo/templates/default.denemo), then it will be opened each time you
 start a new score.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use a Template or Custom Template (See File->Open menu)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use Menus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create an init.denemo score with everything you want to start up with, and
 any actions you want to be taken before you begin.
 This will be opened when you first start Denemo (that is once per Denemo
 session).
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 for details on what actions you can have Denemo perform before you start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using Templates to Setup Scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo comes with a few preinstalled templates.
 You can also create your own templates as well, in fact you can use any
 Denemo file as a template, just open it using File->Open->Open Custom Template.
 (The only difference is that, opened this way, the score is a new i.e.
 untitled score)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

More Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Transposition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo has much better transposition facilities than the common music notation
 programs such as Sibelius, Finale and Musescore.
 If you have used those programs you are probably thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I need to transpose this music
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, meaning you are going to change all the notes and chords you have entered
 along with the key signatures.
 You 
\series bold
can 
\series default
do this in Denemo (see Physical Transposition
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Physical-Transposition"

\end_inset

) but usually it is far better just to say that you want score to be typeset
 in the new key.
 This takes care of everything in one go - even footnotes that refer to
 the pitches of notes in the music will transpose (unless you have entered
 them as fixed values).
 And your input music stays looking just as you entered it - essential if
 you have to look back and compare with a source for instance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands to tranpose a score are in the Score->Typesetter menu.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Transpose on Print
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a graphical user interface - you get presented with a new tab containing
 two notes - clicking the Transpose button will transpose so that the first
 pitch will be typeset as the second one.
 The initial values a C and Eâ­ (up a minor third) so by typing G this would
 become up a fifth.
 The first note could be changed as well, if you know that D should become
 Fâ¯, for example, then you can make those the two notes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other command is quicker but more technical - (Print) Transposed lets
 you type in the names of the two notes.
 The technical bit is how you specify sharp and flat and which octave.
 To specify sharp the note is followed by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for flat 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

es
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (these are actually the Dutch names!).
 Octaves are indicated by ' for up and , for down, so for example c c,,
 would mean transpose two octaves down.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Physical Transposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Physical-Transposition"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case where you have changed your mind and want the actual notes you
 have entered to be altered the commands to do this are in the Notes/Rests->Tran
spose menu.
 The most general of the commands are Arbitrary Transpose Down and Arbitrary
 Transpose Up.
 These allow you to describe the interval you want to transpose the music
 by e.g.
 m7 for a minor seventh, d5 for diminished 5th.
 Alternatively you can use two pitches to describe the interval as in the
 previous section.
 Note that these commands work on the note/chord at the cursor or the selection;
 any key signatures will need changing separately if needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Search and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Replace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two categories of search available in Denemo.
 The first is in Navigation->Seek menu and the other is in the Edit menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Navigation->Seek is the command to find a selected rhythmic pattern (Ctrl-f,
 Ctrl-f) - that is to find a sequence of notes with the same rhythms as
 those of the selection.
 Once found the pattern can be edited, either manually or by executing a
 series of steps recorded in the Scheme window (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Recording-a-Denemo"

\end_inset

).
 There is also a command to find to find a sequence of selected notes.
 In both these cases the search can be resumed by executing the command
 with no selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second sort of seach is in the Edit menu.
 Ctrl-e,e starts a search for objects of the type that the cursor is on,
 while Ctrl-e, Ctrl-e offers all the types of object in the movement and
 allows you to select which to search for.
 Ctrl-e,r resumes the search.
 When found the object can be manually edited, deleted or modified using
 recorded commands as described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Piano Staffs, Orchestral Scores etc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A piano staff can be added using the Staff->Add Staff menu.
 In addition, piano staffs, and staff groups such as choir staff can be
 created using the Staff Groupings menu under the staff menu.
 You can set a piano staff within a staff group by setting successively
 the StartPiano and StartGroup contexts on a single staff, or more generally
 setting StartPiano, EndPiano on adjacent staffs within a staff group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Single Staff Polyphony
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the Staffs/Voices->Voices menu for placing more than one voice on a
 staff.
 You can set the initial voice number from this menu (voices 1 and 3 are
 stem up with slurs and ties etc adjusting to suit, voices 2 and 4 are stem
 down).
 Directives can be placed in the music to change voice, see Directives->Typesett
er->Voices menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will also need spacer rests for voices that are silent, and commands
 to displace rests vertically and horizontally (see Notes/Rests->Rest Insertion
 menu), and commands from the Voices menu under the Staffs/Voices and Directives
->Typesetter menus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Entering Figured Bass
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enter figures choose Notes/Rests->Markings->Figured Bass.
 There are some shortcuts that enable all the work to be done with the numeric
 keypad.
 A brief summary is given by right clicking the option.
 The conventions are described in the LilyPond docs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a MIDI filter for entering figured bass in the Input->MIDI
 menu.
 With this you play the bass note at the cursor and then the notes that
 the figures are indicating; on releasing the bass note the figures are
 entered for that bass note.
 The footpedal allows a sequence of figures to be entered on one note and
 also to enter extenders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fret Diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fret Diagrams can be placed on the score using the command Fret Diagram
 in the ObjectMenu->Directives->Markings menu In addition by assigning a
 Denemo staff to display as fret diagrams, chords can be entered in standard
 notation which will then be dislayed as fret diagrams.
 See ObjectMenu->StaffMenu->StaffPropertiesMenu->FretDiagrams for this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Tablature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Music can be displayed in tablature - the default is for standard guitar
 tuning but others can be set.
 The menus to explore are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ObjectMenu->StaffMenu->StaffPropertiesMenu->Tablature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
ObjectMenu->Directives->Typesetter->Tablature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to display the same music as both notation and tablature,
 and example of how to do this will be found under File->Open->Open Example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Entering Chord Symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two quite different ways to enter chord symbols.
 If the chord changes do not happen mid-way through notes then you can use
 Notes/Rests->Markings->Chord Symbols to attach chord symbols to the notes
 themselves.
 A brief summary is given by right clicking the option.
 The conventions are described in the LilyPond documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative is to set a staff to display not the chords in regular notation
 but the chord symbol that represents the chord.
 Create a staff and use Staff->Staff Properties->Chord Symbols.
 Then this case you enter actual chords which will be displayed as Chord
 Symbols.
 The duration of the chords will determine the positioning, enabling chord
 changes mid-note.
 The chord symbols can then be arranged above or below the melody or other
 representation of the piece using Staffs->Swap Staffs or creating a custom
 layout in the Score Layout window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chord Charts can also be created - there is a Chord Charts palette for these.
 Compact chord charts require a patch to LilyPond - enquire on the mailing
 list for this.

Adding and Editing Key/Mouse Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo allows you to choose which keys activate which commands (shortcuts).
 It also allows you to choose Mouse press/release gestures (in combination
 with keys such as 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
NumLock
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CapsLock
\family default
 etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sub:The-Command-Center"

\end_inset

 for setting shortcuts.
 The following quicker method can also be used for one-key shortcuts.
 To choose a shortcut for a menu item, select the item (it becomes highlighted)
 and press the key that you want to become the shortcut.
 If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command,
 you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or
 steal the shortcut.
 Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say
 the 
\family typewriter
NumLock
\family default
 down and those without or to ignore it.
 If the 
\family typewriter
NumLock
\family default
 is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting
 of 
\family typewriter
NumLock
\family default
 is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the 
\family typewriter
NumLock
\family default
 was off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist
 in bright blue lettering.
 PrsL-
\family typewriter
CapsLoc
\family default
, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the 
\family typewriter
CapsLock
\family default
 light is on.
 In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so
 that together with the RlsL-
\family typewriter
CapsLoc
\family default
 for the release of the left mouse button, you can "draw" slurs by using
 the mouse.
 Similarly, 
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
 with left mouse button (MveL-
\family typewriter
Shift
\family default
) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff.
 (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For mouse shortcuts invoke the Command Center with the right click on the
 menu item.
 The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action
 you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking
 on the big button.
 The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it.

It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with.
 Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as
 to keep the menu sizes manageable.
 Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you
 can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default
 setup.
 Scheme to be executed at startup can be placed in the denemo.scm file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
An example - quicker dynamics selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be slow to choose dynamics (
\family typewriter
Ctrl-D
\family default
) because the list is quite long to move down (or move to the mouse).
 You can define a list of the dynamics you actually want to be readily available
 as for example: (define DenemoDynamicList '(("f" "127" "Forte") ("p" "127"
 "Piano"))) This makes forte available just by pressing Return and piano
 available by pressing down arrow Return.
 (The others via More of course).
 If you place this in (home directory)/.denemo-x.x.x/actions/denemo.scm then
 it will be defined when you start Denemo.

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can record a frequently used sequence of actions into the Scheme window.
 These can be used in search and replace operations or they can be installed
 as a command in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut or placed
 in a palette.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To do this choose View->Scheme Script.
 (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!) In
 the window that pops up check Record Scheme Script and then do the set
 of steps you wish Denemo to record.
 As you execute each command the Scheme window gets that command added to
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, suppose you wanted to place a trill on a particular note in
 a certain rhythmic pattern that occurs frequently in a piece.
 You would record the cursor moves and the Trill command needed to edit
 the pattern concerned and then use the Search and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 facility to seek the pattern you needed selecting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Continue

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Execute Scheme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as each pattern is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Or, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands
 to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?).
 You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then move the
 cursor right two steps and delete the previous note (with Backspace if
 that is your shortcut).
 (Each time you use a command you will see the Scheme syntax for that command
 entered into the Scheme window).
 Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new
 command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window.
 To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item
 (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save
 Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your
 new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit->Customi
ze Commands...->Manage Command Set->Save as Default Command Set).
 If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you
 exit.
 Otherwise you can re-load via the More->My Commands menu item.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Editing a LilyPond Tweak
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which
 is by modifying a tweak that has already been done.
 This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive
 (usually found under the Advanced button provided in the Object Editor
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Object-Editor"

\end_inset

).
 Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there
 is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter.
 You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be
 used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be
 positioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by
 right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command,
 and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above.
 An alternative to creating a command in the menu system is to create a
 palette button (see the Object Editor
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Object-Editor"

\end_inset

).

Writing Scheme Scripts

\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme
 Script window to create any command you want.
 Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt
 other scripts to do what you want.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive
 into the score.
 This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond
 in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments
/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories
 in the same way as the menu system itself).
 Then choose Get Script into Scheme Window from the right click menu.
 With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window.
 Here you can see the part that says
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
which is inserting the LilyPond directive "
\backslash
mark 
\backslash
default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark.
 (The extra backslashes are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean
 a 
\backslash
 sign).
 You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need - always
 doubling the 
\backslash
 signs.
 The you can save as a new menu item, a palette button, or use Save Script
 from Scheme Window to customize the command you started with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available.
 Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command
 Center window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined.

\begin_layout Standard
Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument
 is passed to them from Scheme.
 In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value" is
 passed these will be used and no popup will occur.
 The field "name" will be given the value "value".
 The 
\backslash
0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings.
 As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass
 the value.
 The names of the fields depend on the action being called.
 So for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Midi Filters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever
 you wish.
 One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures
 by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the
 bass note.
 Another is the "AngryDelete" filter.
 With this filter on notes are entered normally with the cursor advancing
 automatically, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just
 hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI
 filters are found under Input -> MIDI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
LilyPond Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within
 Denemo.
 This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.g.
 multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo.
 The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which
 you can use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable
 template or example file exists).
 Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks
 from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output
 and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing
 of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep
 separate LilyPond files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using the LilyPond Window
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with
 the LilyPond output in it.
 The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show
 the various sections or to create custom versions.
 The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between
 editing textually and editing in Denemo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text.
 LilyPond text can be inserted between notes, and the final section (the
 score layout) can be turned into editable text (see Score Layout).
 There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current
 Denemo object.
 Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo
 window cursor to move in synchronism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond
 text in the window.
 This means you can open specific custom score layouts and print from them,
 or even make a temporary edit for just one print.
 If you save the score with custom layouts then these are remembered.
 So when you reload and the custom score layout will be printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Detail
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several custom layouts can be kept, selecting them in the Score Layout view
 enables the same Denemo file to print a variety of things from the same
 music input.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group
 of staffs or even a piano reduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons.
 These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so
 the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as "MvmntIVoiceIMus
ic" and so on.
 Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between
 notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks) and the text inserted
 will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you
 are editing.
 (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in
 the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just
 before the note name - one of the arrow keys will do).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Custom layout blocks can be created by right-clicking on the Standard score
 layout and selecting create custom score layout.
 The Score Layout window allows creation of customized layouts via a GUI.
 If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock
 for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print
 command prints, e.g.
 both a full score and parts.
 Using the 
\backslash
book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder
 .denemo in your home folder).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks
 at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIMusic.
 This means that the same music can be output in several different ways,
 so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output
 the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceITimeSig 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIKeySig 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIClef} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MvmntIVoiceIMusic = {
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceIProlog 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceI}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\backslash
MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other
 definitions hold the time signature, clef etc.
 By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still
 maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do
 if you never look at the LilyPond window.
 What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then
 this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part.
 However, if you use the File->Print command then it prints the first custom
 scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do
 not have any custom scoreblocks).

\begin_layout Standard
By saving a Denemo score with a script defined (in the script window) you
 can create music lessons, automatic midi player...
 the possibilities are endless.
 When you open such a score, the script is run - it can take user input
 and manipulate the score, or do other actions as your fancy takes you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a special score init.denemo that is run on startup.
 By editing this you can startup with whatever template and whatever actions
 you wish to be performed.
 If you set it to do something that quits Denemo, you may need to delete
 the file before using Denemo normally again.
 Your local init.denemo is stored in the directory .denemo/actions in your
 home directory.To create it put the script you want in the script window
 and use SaveAs selecting ~/.denemo/actions/init.denemo as your file to save
 to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What Happens at Startup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Denemo Directives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can
 be changed by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score
 and can modify the behavior of the element concerned.
 They contain fields to describe how the element's properties should be
 modified, either in the display or in the printing.
 Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print
 properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify
 them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows.
 This means Denemo can grow - you can add features - without getting a new
 version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo.
 Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an
 image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond
 syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate
 that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start
 of the score and just before each movement.
 The display field is shown at the top of the display.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
scoreheader: Attached to the score.
 The postfix field is put inside a 
\backslash
header{} block at the start of the score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement.
 The prefix field is placed before the movements 
\backslash
score{} block, the postfix after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
header: Attached to a movement.
 As scoreheader but for 
\backslash
header{} blocks inside the movement's score block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
paper: Attached to the score.
 The postfix is placed inside a 
\backslash
paper{} block.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
layout: Attached to a movement.
 The postfix is placed inside a 
\backslash
layout{} block in the movement's scoreblock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change.
 The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position.
 The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is
 found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change.
 The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position.
 The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature
 is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures.
 (e.g.
 used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display
 field printed at the start of the staff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field
 printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element - it comes with
 the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and
 the postfix after it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the
 postfix after it.
 Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc.
 Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned
 relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic)
 and tx, ty for the display text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontr
ol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone,

 LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo
 display for the item.
 A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which
 can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional
 information not explicit in the music notation (e.g.
 the tempo of an Adagio marking).

\begin_layout Subsection
Directive Edit Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic - a button
 then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive.
 Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the
 staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below).
 Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive
 object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it.
 What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name
 of the directive.
 For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMa
rk" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing
 script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname).
 This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly.
 The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirecti
ve EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective
 EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

end{verbatim}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Where <tagname> specifies the directive to be edited and <field> is one
 of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig,
 keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example,

gives low-level access to the directive setting the print all headers command

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Initialization Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each menu can have an initialization script, which can contain procedures
 that would be too time consuming to define every time they are needed.
 These scripts are guaranteed to be run before any menu item is activated
 within the menu.
 They can be read/written using the right click menu on any scripted menu
 item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Edit Scripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each directive has a tag field, so that it can be recognized by the scripts
 that manipulate it.
 In particular for each tag there can be an edit script, for editing a directive
 of that tag.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the
 directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can read and write edit scripts by using the low level editing dialog
 on a directive with the tag you are writing for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The low level editing dialog is the one that is presented if there is no
 edit script.
 Edit scripts can themselves give access to this dialog by including an
 option cue-Advanced which calls (d-DirectiveTextEdit-field tag) for the
 appropriate field and tag.
 For an example see the edit script for Instruments -> Orchestra -> RehearsalMar
k.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are
 defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup.
 The functions and variables for script editing are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options
 to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.
 More useful commands RadioBoxMenu and RadioBoxMenuList are built on this
 for a nicer interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extra-Offset tag type context.
 Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited,
 which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive
 (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond
 context of the object.
 Only tag is required.
 Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SetPadding tag type context.
 As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond
 engraving process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SetRelativeFontSize tag type context.
 As Extra-Offset, it shifts the font size of the following text in the LilyPond
 engraving process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CreateButton tag label this is just a convenience function to put a button
 with the passed in label onto a button box at the top of the screen.
 Scripts can attach actions to such tagged buttons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
d-SetDirectiveTagActionScript tag scheme-actions.
 This command sets scheme-actions as the actions to be performed when the
 button of the given tag is clicked.
 The default action is to run any editscript associated with tag, and if
 none to run the d-DirectiveTextEdit-score on the directive that displays
 the button.
