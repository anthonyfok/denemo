/**
 *
 * \mainpage General usage instructions
 *
 * An smf_t structure represents a "song".  Every valid smf contains one or more tracks.
 * Tracks contain zero or more events.  Libsmf doesn't care about actual MIDI data, as long
 * as it is valid from the MIDI specification point of view - it may be realtime message,
 * SysEx, whatever.
 * 
 * The only field in smf_t, smf_track_t, smf_event_t and smf_tempo_t structures your
 * code may modify is event->midi_buffer and event->midi_buffer_length.  Do not modify
 * other fields, _ever_.  You may read them, though.
 * 
 * Say you want to load a Standard MIDI File (.mid) file and play it back somehow.  This is (roughly)
 * how you do this:
 * 
 * \code
 * 	smf_t *smf = smf_load(file_name);
 * 	if (smf == NULL) {
 * 		Whoops, something went wrong.
 * 		return;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	for (;;) {
 * 		smf_event_t *event = smf_get_next_event(smf);
 * 		if (event == NULL) {
 * 			No more events, end of the song.
 * 			return;
 * 		}
 *
 *		if (smf_event_is_metadata(event))
 *			continue;
 * 
 * 		wait until event->time_seconds.
 * 		feed_to_midi_output(event->midi_buffer, event->midi_buffer_length);
 * 	}
 *
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Saving works like this:
 * 
 * \code
 *
 * 	smf_t *smf = smf_new();
 * 	if (smf == NULL) {
 * 		Whoops.
 * 		return;
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	for (int i = 1; i <= number of tracks; i++) {
 * 		smf_track_t *track = smf_track_new();
 * 		if (track == NULL) {
 * 			Whoops.
 * 			return;
 * 		}
 * 
 * 		smf_add_track(smf, track);
 * 
 * 		for (int j = 1; j <= number of events in this track; j++) {
 * 			smf_event_t *event = smf_event_new_from_pointer(your MIDI message, message length);
 * 			if (event == NULL) {
 * 				Whoops.
 * 				return;
 * 			}
 * 
 * 			smf_track_add_event_seconds(track, event, seconds since start of the song);
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * 
 * 	ret = smf_save(smf, file_name);
 * 	if (ret) {
 * 		Whoops, saving failed for some reason.
 * 		return;
 * 	}
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * There are two basic ways of getting MIDI data out of smf - sequential or by track/event number.  You may
 * mix them if you need to.  First one is used in the example above - seek to the point from which you want
 * the playback to start (using smf_seek_to_seconds, for example) and then do smf_get_next_event in loop,
 * until it returns NULL.  After smf_load smf is rewound to the start of the song.
 *
 * Getting events by number works like this:
 *
 * \code
 *
 * smf_track_t *track = smf_get_track_by_number(smf, track_number);
 * smf_event_t *event = smf_track_get_event_by_number(track, event_number);
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * Tracks and events are numbered consecutively, starting from one.  If you remove a track or event,
 * the rest of tracks/events will be renumbered.  To get number of event in its track, use event->event_number.
 * To get the number of track in its smf, use track->track_number.  To get the number of events in the track,
 * use track->number_of_events.  To get the number of tracks in the smf, use smf->number_of_tracks.
 *
 * In SMF File Format, each track has to end with End Of Track metaevent.  If you load SMF file using smf_load,
 * that will be the case.  If you want to create or edit an SMF, you don't need to worry about EOT events,
 * libsmf automatically takes care of them for you.  If you try to save an SMF with tracks that do not end
 * with EOTs, smf_save will append them.  If you try to add event that happens after EOT metaevent, libsmf
 * will remove the EOT.  If you want to add EOT automatically, you can, of course, using smf_track_add_eot_seconds
 * or smf_track_add_eot_pulses.
 *
 * Each event carries three time values - event->time_seconds, which is seconds since the start of the song,
 * event->time_pulses, which is PPQN clocks since the start of the song, and event->delta_pulses, which is PPQN clocks
 * since the previous event in that track.  These values are invalid if the event is not attached to the track.
 * If event is attached, all three values are valid.  Time of the event is specified when adding the event
 * (smf_track_add_event_seconds/smf_track_add_event_pulses/smf_track_add_event_delta_pulses); the remaining
 * two values are computed from that.
 *
 * Tempo related stuff happens automatically - when you add a metaevent that
 * is Tempo Change or Time Signature, libsmf adds that event to the tempo map.  If you remove
 * Tempo Change event that is in the middle of the song, the rest of the events will have their
 * event->time_seconds recomputed from event->time_pulses before smf_track_remove_event function returns.
 * Adding Tempo Change in the middle of the song works in a similar way.
 * 	
 * MIDI data (event->midi_buffer) are always in normalized form - they always begin with status byte
 * (no running status), there are no system realtime events embedded in them etc.  Events like SysExes
 * are in "on the wire" form, without embedded length that is used in SMF file format.  Obviously
 * libsmf "normalizes" MIDI data during loading and "denormalizes" (adding length to SysExes, escaping
 * System Common and System Realtime messages etc) during writing.
 *
 * Note that you always have to first add the track to smf, and then add events to the track.
 * Doing it the other way around will trip asserts.  Also, try to add events at the end of the track and remove
 * them from the end of the track, that's much more efficient.
 * 
 * All the libsmf functions have prefix "smf_".  Library does not use any global variables and is thread-safe,
 * as long as you don't try to work on the same SMF (smf_t and it's descendant tracks and events) from several
 * threads at once without protecting it with mutex.  Library depends on glib and nothing else.  License is
 * BSD, two clause.
