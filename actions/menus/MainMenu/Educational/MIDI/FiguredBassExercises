  "The music below is the first of Handel's exercises for figured bass. The staff marked \"Chords\" at the top is a sample (inadequate) realization of the figures.
 When you click Start you will be asked if you want to delete this version, and when you say yes you can start creating your own.
 The screen becomes green to remind you that your MIDI controller is now expecting you to play the ticked bass note plus chord.
 The bass note expected is marked with a tick, play this note plus the chord notes. You can hold down the bass note and change chords over the same bass note.
 And you can hold down the chord while going on to the next bass note so as to carry the chord over.
 You can click Start a second time to stop, and you can re-start from any bar you like.
