(d-InfoDialog "The Return keypress can be used as a special instantly movable shortcut,\nyou can set it to any menu action you wish by pressing it while you have the item selected\nAny one-key shortcut can be set this way, but with Return you do not get told if you are taking the shortcut away from another command.\nAlso the setting is not saved.\nThe idea is to set it for your current activity (e.g. applying tenuto marks).\nYou can make it \"normal\" by setting a preference - see Edit-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Command Behavior.\nNote that the Enter key on the numeric keypad is a separate key (or should be!) and can be used as a shortcut independently")
