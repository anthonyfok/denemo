;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Paste by Nils Gey // 2010
; Singlestaff pasting will begin where the cursor is, resulting easily in overfull measures, but it turned out that exactly this is often intended.
; Multistaff-Pasting always adds the complete part after the current measure. It will never paste into an existing measure

(d-UnsetMark)
(d-PushPosition) 

;;;;;Preparation. Check if the user only wants to paste a part of a measure or at least one complete measure and add an initial blank measure for that.
;Multi staff selection is only possible for complete measures, not for parts. But In this case the first thing that needs to happen before beginning pasting to a new staff (including the first one) is to create an empty measure.
(if (d-GetClipObjType 1 0)
	(d-InsertMeasureAfter)
	(let searchformeasurebreak ((counter 0))  ; If there is no measurebreak at all in the clipboard: Do not create a blank one
		(case (d-GetClipObjType 0 counter) 
		  ((#f) #f ) ; No object left
		  ((8) (d-InsertMeasureAfter)) ; Measurebreak
		  (else (searchformeasurebreak (+ 1 counter)))
   		)
	)
)


;;;;;; Main Loop. 
 (let loopy ((staff 0) (count 0))
  ;Pasty is the default command which just inserts the clipboard-object and increases the object-counter, but does not touch the staff-counter
  (define (pasty)
  	(d-PutClipObj staff count)
  	(set! count (+ 1 count))
  	(loopy staff count))

 ; Nextplease increases the object-counter without pasting anything.
  (define (nextplease)
	(set! count (+ 1 count))
  	(loopy staff count))
 
 ;Nextstaff inserts a new measure only in this new staff! It is not possible to add a measure in all staffs because its possible to copy&amp;paste only 2 out of n staffs. In such cases it would lead to empty measure in other staffs. Afterwards reset the object-counter to zero and increase the staff-counter to start a new pasting round.
;First go to the initial cursor position, then move staff down.
 (define (nextstaff)
   (if (= staff 0)  
          (d-PopPushPosition) ; remember the  end-position of the cursor only for the first staff to return there after paste

    )
  )

; In the end move cusor to the initial staff, after the pasted part to allow direct pasting and editing again.

; The real action: Get the type of clipboard-object and decide what to do. In most cases it will be just pasting but someties special behaviour is needed. Because pasting a staffbreak does not actually moves the cursor to the new staff so this has to be done manually.
