You can type music in using the keyboard 
    or play it in using a MIDI contoller or the microphone input. You can edit your music - the display shows you the measures you
    are working on - and you can playback selected bits to check how it sounds. 
    You can preview and print the score or parts to the highest standards used in the music publishing industry 
    - thanks to the Lilypond typesetting program.</p><p>Denemo does not attempt to show the appearance of the finished score, it just shows you enough to enable you to enter the music efficiently.

Finally (and every time you ask for a new blank score) your default template (~/.denemo/templates/default.denemo) is loaded. In this file you can keep your favorite paper margins etc.
</p><p>In addition, on startup a set of keyboard and mouse shortcuts, and a selection of optional menu items are loaded.

</p></div><p>Denemo is used via the computer keyboard, MIDI controller or playing in via a musical instrument. Quite a few mouse operations are also included by default. Clicking on the score will select items, and the status bar at the bottom will describe the item clicked. Left clicking on items in the score allows you to edit any special attributes, (called Directives, see <a href="#DenemoDirectives" title="Denemo Directives">the section called &#8220;Denemo Directives&#8221;</a>), that they may have. Clicking on the initial clef, key or timesignature lets you edit these, clicking to the right or left of the measures visible moves you forwards and backwards in the score. Clicking in the top left corner allows you to edit Directives that apply to the whole score. Selections can be made by dragging with the mouse from one note to another. And right-clicking any menu item gets help and the opportunity to set a shortcuts for the menu item. Furthermore, scripts are available in the menu system that give the mouse further uses.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2770541"></a>Overall View of Denemo</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2770547"></a>General Concepts</h3></div></div></div><p>
    The unit of work in Denemo is a musical score, which can be saved in a single file (with .denemo suffix). This is represented on the screen by a "tab". If you have several tabs open at once they appear just above the music in the main window, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tab.
 </p><p>
    One score may contain several movements, which you can move between, insert and delete with the Movements menu. A movement is a continuous piece of music with titles etc.
 </p><p>
    Within a movement there are staffs (arranged vertically) and within the staffs Denemo Objects. These can be notes, chords and Denemo Directives (see  <a href="#DenemoDirectives" title="Denemo Directives">the section called &#8220;Denemo Directives&#8221;</a>). The notes and chords are displayed in conventional format (though not fully typeset). The Denemo Directives are used for most things that are not chords or notes: Metronome marks, repeat barlines etc are good examples. They can also be attached to chords, individual notes in a chord, to a staff as a whole and to the score as a whole. Each Denemo Directive carries its own display method. For example the Close Repeat barline appears as a Denemo Object in the converional music notation, while a Directive attached to a staff (e.g. Smaller Staff) may just print "Smaller Staff" over the staff. The directive then directs the LilyPond typesetter to make the staff smaller.
</p><p>
    The command Edit Object gives access to editing Denemo Directives, which generally have their own edit methods. You can use the Print View to indicate the padding that you wish to apply to some item, or to show where you want to drag it to.
    </p><p>
    The titles of the current movement can be set. These titles should be left blank for movements after the first if they apply to the whole score (a LilyPond peculiarity). In the movement properties dialog you can set a LilyPond directive to cause a page break before the movement (see LilyPond docs, but briefly #f is no page break and #t (true) is page break). You can include any other directives here to apply to the movement as a whole.
    </p><p>
Each Denemo file represents a piece of music which may consist of several &#8220;movements&#8221;, interspersed with headings. These might be different songs in a song book, or literally the movements in a classical sonata, or any other pieces of music that you want to print out in a book form with titles, page numbering and so on.

The main window has menus and toolbars at the top. With View-&gt;Score View checked there is next the drawing area where the music input is displayed - just the few measures you are working on. With View-&gt;Print View checked there is another pane showing the print preview of your score. At the bottom is a status line showing which movement you are in and what sort of object the cursor is on. If there are any MIDI filters that active they will be noted at the right in the status bar. The small colored rectangle is the Denemo Cursor, which shows where notes etc will be added/edited next. Selected music is colored blue and outlined with a blue rectangle.
</p><p>
The menus in Denemo are unusual: they not only let you do some particular action, but also each menu item lets you enquire what the action does in more detail and lets you set keyboard/mouse shortcuts for the actions. All this extra functionality &amp; more comes with right-clicking the menu item, while the usual left click is for executing the action itself. The menus can always be torn off for working with particular items (e.g. working with different movements or with measures, dynamics etc.). Also available by right-clicking is creating new actions - often by modifying ones that are already there.

Right clicking in this pane allows you to refresh the print preview (the program hangs waiting for LilyPond to finish).</p><p> Right clicking in this pane also allows you to choose offsets to apply to items that LilyPond has positioned badly.Or you can select an amount of padding to apply to some object. This is generally a better way of indicating that it is too close to something else, since other objects will move away from it as needed - that is, if you later edit something it will behave more intelligently. The actual editing is always done in the Score View pane, choosing Edit Object while the cursor is on the offending object and then dragging in the Print Preview window to indicate the amount of change required.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2770086"></a>The Main Menubar</h2></div></div></div><p>The Main Menubar has submenus for overall control of the program.

The different modes are useful for different ways or phases of work.</p><p>  With the standard keyboard shortcuts the modes work like this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No Mode. No standard keypresses are defined &#8211; you will need to assign keys yourself. You will need to define separate keypresses to insert the notes, change the notes, move the cursor to a note, change the prevailing duration, etc. This mode is for those who want to set up the keys to have single functions. The cursor is green in this mode. This mode gives easy access via the menus for the actions that do not change with modes.
		 </p></li><li><p>Insert Mode. In this mode the keys 0,1,2... select the prevailing duration (whole-note, half-note ...) while the Note name keys A,B,C ... insert a note of that name in the prevailing duration. The octave is the one nearest the cursor. The cursor is green in this mode. This mode is good for entering single line music.
		 </p></li><li><p>Edit Mode. In this mode the keys 0,1,2... insert a note (whole-note, half-note ...) at the current cursor position, while the Note name keys A,B,C ... change the note at the cursor to A,B,C.... The cursor is purple. This mode is good for editing music already entered and for entering pure rhythms (all notes on the same pitch, for overlaying pitches via microphone input later). You can also enter music in this mode - you type the duration key (which inserts a note) and then the Note name key, which edits it to the one you want.
		 </p></li><li><p>Classic Mode. In this mode the keys 0,1,2... insert a note (whole-note, half-note ...) at the cursor position, while the Note name keys A,B,C ... move the cursor. The cursor is green. This mode is good for entering music with chords (Enter is the standard keybinding for this).
		 </p></li><li><p> Entry types: Note, Rest, Non-Printing Rests, Rhythm. These are used with the above modes to control what is entered. The unusual one here is Rhythm entry, which gives audio feedback when entering pure rhythms, enabling you to enter rhythms without looking at the screen to check that you have entered the correct duration. Non-Printing rests allows you to make a part vanish and return when writing several parts to a staff.

If you have a pattern in your music that appears many times you only need to type it once. By selecting it and clicking Create Pattern you install that pattern on the toolbar. Then as you enter notes (in Insert Mode) the notes follow the rhythmic pattern chosen. Pressing a duration key goes back to adding notes of the prevailing duration. You can have several custom patterns like this and switch between them using the space bar (or other keybinding of your choice). Another (more musical) way of entering rhythms is to "drum" them in using the keys on the computer keyboard for quarter-note, eighth-note etc, a curious sort of "musical instrument" where you change key for different durations. Use the numeric keypad for this. Drumming in is quickly learnt and, by playing in the notes rhythmically you can keep your place in the music. Use the mode-&gt;Rhythm Mode option for this, so that you get a bell to confirm when you have completed a measure.</p><p>Using Input-&gt;Midi or Audio allows you to enter pitches directly. If you have entered your piece of music as pure rhythm you can overlay with the pitches using a MIDI controller or musical instrument with mic, headphones out or pickup attached to your soundcard.

    Denemo can take pitches directly from MID input. Select Input-&gt;Midi Input. The control window allows you to choose the enharmonic range. Under Mode-&gt;MIDI are various "MIDI filters" that allow you to control how the MIDI input is used: with none active the behaviour is as if you had entered the notes using the pc-keyboard (except that octave, accidental and note name are all entered in one go). You can also use Advance on Edit to put the pitches onto pre-entered rhythms, or Check Pitches (where you play through the piece and a warning is issued if you hit a wrong note).
</p><p>
   These MIDI filters are scheme scripts, so they can be tailored to do whatever you wish. One example is a filter that enables you to enter Figured Bass figures by playing the notes corresponding to the figures while holding down the bass note. Chords could be entered using similar code.
</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2772605"></a>Playing Notes into Denemo - Audio (Souncard Mic Input)</h2></div></div></div><p>
Denemo can listen for, and detect the pitch of notes on the mic input of the computer; it doesn't attempt to guess the rhythm - such systems do not work well - but you will find that playing the notes in time will help you to play them in, as well as make playing them in a musical experience rather than a chore.
</p><p>Playing the notes in can be much quicker than using the keyboard since the note octave and accidental are all given just by playing the note. If you are able to play a musical instrument then this will probably be much faster for you than typing note names, octave shifts and accidentals at the computer keyboard. Using the headphones out of an electronic keyboard avoids "noises-off" interfering with the pitch detection. Many microphones and pickups benefit from some pre-amplification - it is worth getting the level right before you begin.</p><p>When you select the Input-&gt;Audio on the Main Menu the Pitch Recognition window pops up. While the mouse pointer is inside the score drawing area the score is sensitive to pitches heard via the microphone input. The background colour of the score changes to show that the notes will be entered into the score. </p><p>There are two ways of using the pitch entry - Overlay mode (default) and Insert mode. The button marked Insert causes notes to be entered into the current measure in the prevailing rhythm - the mode is set to Insert for this. The button marked Overlays overlays the notes already present with the pitches you sound. There is a third button, marked Tuning, which is a state-of-the art musical instrument tuner.</p><p>
Music is entered into the measure which holds the cursor. If you are overlaying a rhythm already entered, then the first un-overlayed note in the measure is overlayed by the note detected. You can delete the overlay using the regular delete keys, or clear them altogether if you want to start over in a measure. If you are in Insert mode then the notes detected will be inserted at the cursor position.
</p><p>Use the enharmonic shift to select whether Bb or A# should be entered when you enter the given pitch - you can usefully go as far as B# and Fb.</p><p>Use the transpose control to shift up or down by octaves.</p><p>Most of the other settings would require study of the Aubio documentation to understand, but the one marked threshold may be useful to make the detection less sensitive to ambient noises if using a microphone with an acoustic instrument.</p><p> The best set-up is to plug the headphones-out socket of an electronic keyboard into the mic input, and choose a piano setting on the electronic keyboard.</p><p> If you don't have any musical instrument that you can plug directly into the mic in, then you can use an acoustic instrument with a microphone, in which case move your microphone closer or further from your instrument to get reliable detection. Too close and you get double detections, too far and you get missed ones. To check for good detection open a piece of music, set Overlay mode and put the cursor in the first measure and play the piece in &#8211; the notes should all turn blue if you have perfect detection. It is worth while getting perfect detection &#8211; more than one or two miss-detects per piece of music and you may want to use the Insert rather than the Overlay method.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2772712"></a>Understanding Modes</h2></div></div></div><p>Modes in Denemo are optional. Denemo has a large number of actions (functions) that it can execute for you, and these are to be found in the View-\&gt;Objects Menu (grouped by objects such as note, measure, clef etc. Some of these functions do different things in different modes. For example the key A is usually bound to a function that moves the cursor to the nearest note A, or inserts a note A, or changes the current note to an A, all depending on which mode is chosen. (There are also entry modes, in rest entry mode instead of a note a rest would be inserted). </p><p>If you dislike modal programs, you will set your shortcuts to the non-modal functions (these are found in the View-\&gt;Objects Menu when Mode-\&gt;No Mode is selected, or in the View-\&gt;Actions Menu.)</p><p>
When using a MIDI controller to enter pitches, you can just set the Rhythm entry mode, and never have to switch modes. You select rhythms via the keyboard and edit their pitch with the MIDI in.
</p><p>In addition to the basic Insert and Edit modes there are four entry modes for specialized use. Rest entry is useful for entering a large number of rests. (For single rests it is easier to use a keypress - e.g. Alt-3 for an eighth note). Non-printing rests are used for parts which enter during the course of a measure. Note entry is the default, while in Rhythm entry the different durations have varied audio feedback and a beep is sounded when Denemo moves to the next measure &#8211; this is to help when entering the rhythm of a piece for later overlaying with pitches.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2772766"></a>Basic Use</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="subtitle">Introduction</h4></div></div></div><p>
      Denemo allows you to explore all the actions  (insert/delete/edit/navigate...) using the Objects menu. So inserting notes can be found under Notes/Rests while inserting a Staff comes under Staffs/Voices.

In addition you can customize the mouse actions to initiate commands, and set the cursor that will show while certain mouse conditions apply.

      </p><p>Denemo offers several ways of entering music: typing at the keyboard, playing in via a MIDI keyboard (controller), playing in acoustically using a microphone or choosing items from the menu system. </p><p>Using the menus for everything would be very slow, but next to each menu item is the keypress that you can use instead. If there is no keypress shown, and you want to use that item often, then right click on the menu item and you can set a key combination for that menu action. Right clicking is also useful for getting a description of what the menu action is. </p><p> Typing at the keyboard can be very fast, if you forget which keypress you need you can consult the menu system to find out. This method is good for touch typists.
      </p><p class="persom">For entering a lot of already written-out music, playing the music in via a MIDI keyboard or microphone can offer the fastest and most musical method. </p><p>One way to do this is to choose Rhythm entry mode and enter the music as pure rhythm, ignoring the note names. Each duration sounds its own pitch and length as you enter the durations. As you start each measure the bell will sound so that you can keep your eyes on the score you are copying without needing to look up and check that you haven't miss-typed. If you are a reading musician you will find that you tap in the rhythm rhythmically which helps to keep your place in the piece you are entering. </p><p>Once you have entered the rhythms you choose an external source from the Input menu, placing the cursor in the first measure, play the notes via MIDI or a microphone plugged into the mic input of your soundcard. The Audio Input button introduces a special entry mode where the pitches you play in will overlay the rhythm, appearing as blue notes. You can delete any wrong pitches using the usual delete keys, without deleting the rhythm. In fact if you have an "interloper" (an extra spurious note) you can delete it and the other pitches will all move along to their correct places.</p><p>Another method of playing music in acoustically doesn't involve entering the rhythm separately. For this select Input-&gt;Audio and then choose Insert instead of Overlays on the Pitch Recognition Panel that pops up. With Insert the sounded notes are entered as in the prevailing rhythm. The same applies if you have MIDI, only you just need to select Insert mode to enter the notes in that case. So by choosing a rhythm (e.g. half-note, quarter-note, or a custom rhythm pattern) and playing in the pitches you can enter the music into a blank score.</p><p> For MIDI input there are special modes (MIDI filters), such as Advance On Edit, which means you can simply play the pitches in and they are applied to the notes. If you are entering notes and durations at the same time using MIDI then the "AngryDelete" finger can be useful. With this filter on notes are entered normally until, but if you make a mistake and press the wrong note just hit the next one much louder and it will make the correction for you! MIDI filters are found under Mode-&gt;MIDI</p><p>The oldest Denemo keymaps are no longer supported.

It also allows you to choose Mouse press/release gestures (in combination with keys such as Shift, NumLock, CapsLock etc).
 </p><p>
 To choose a shortcut for a menu item, right-click on the item and choose the Create Mouse Shortcut, or the Edit Shortcuts option. The Set Mouse Shortcut Dialog requires you to set which button and action you want to use and then to hold/lock the keyboard modifier while clicking on the big button. The setting you have chosen is shown, and you click ok to accept it.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 To set a keyboard shortcut, and to delete any sort of shortcut, use the Edit Shortcuts menu item. This dialog also allows you to choose a cursor to show while certain mouse actions are underway.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
If your choice of keyboard shortcut already belongs to another command, you are warned about this, and given the chance to change your mind or steal the shortcut. Also, you can choose whether to distinguish between keypresses with, say the NumLock down and those without or to ignore it. If the NumLock is set but no command for that key specifically requires it then the setting of NumLock is ignored and the keypress is treated as if the NumLock was off.
 </p><p>
 The menu item that activates the command shows the shortcuts that exist in bright blue lettering. PrsL-CapsLoc, for example, is the Press action on the Left mouse key while the CapsLock light is on.  In the default command set this is linked to the BeginSlur command, so that together with the RlsL-CapsLoc for the release of the left mouse button, you can "draw" slurs by using the mouse. Similarly, Shift with left mouse button (MveL-Shift) is set to allow you to drag notes up and down the staff. (This is using Command MoveNoteToCursor, which is found under Notes/Rests/Edit/Edit Note/To Cursor)</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2773172"></a>More Commands</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773178"></a>Adding More Features </h3></div></div></div><p>
It is possible to add more commands to the set that Denemo ships with. Some of these are shipped with Denemo, but not added automatically so as to keep the menu sizes manageable. Generally, you right-click to find more menu items to add; once added you can set a keyboard/mouse shortcut and keep the command in your default setup.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773193"></a>Adding Your Own Features </h3></div></div></div><p>
You can also get Denemo to remember a frequently used sequence of actions - it can be installed in the menu system and given a keyboard shortcut just like any other command. </p><p> To do this you right-click and choose Show Scheme Script. (You do not have to understand what a Scheme Script is to use this!). In the little window that pops up set Record Scheme Script and then do the set of steps you wish Denemo to remember, <span class="emphasis"><em>using the menu items, not keyboard, for each step</em></span>.
  </p><p>As a simple example, suppose you wanted a command to delete the next note (there are commands to delete the previous note and the current note, so why not?). You would enter some notes, put on Record Scheme Script and then from the menu Cursor select Cursor Right (to move on to the note to be deleted), and with the Notes/Rests-&gt;Delete-&gt;Delete Object menu item you would delete the note. (Each time you use a menu item you will see a new command entered into the Scheme window). Now turn off Record Scheme Script and you can experiment with your new command by pressing Execute in the Scheme Script window. To save this new command for future use, you right click on a menu item (in the menu where you would like the command to appear) and choose "Save Script as New Menu Item", this will ask you to make up a name for your new command as well as a label for the menu item etc.

 </p><p> You can save the command in your default sequence of commands (via Edit-&gt;Customize Commands...-&gt;Manage Command Set-&gt;Save as Default Command Set). If not you will be asked if you want to save your new commands when you exit. Otherwise you can re-load via the More-&gt;My Commands menu item.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773244"></a>An even easier way</h3></div></div></div><p>
   There is an even easier way of adding your own favorite LilyPond tweaks, which is by modifying a tweak that has already been done. This can be done by using the text-edit dialog on an existing Denemo Directive (usually found under the Advanced button provided by an edit script). Here you can see the actual LilyPond text that will be inserted, and there is a button to create a script to generate whatever you choose to enter. You can also enter the name of graphic images (.png files) that are to be used to represent your item in the display, and say where it should be positioned.
  </p><p>
Once you have created the script, it can be saved in the menu system by right clicking on an item in the menu where you want to place the command, and choosing "Save Script as New Menu Item" as above.
   </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773271"></a>Writing Scheme Scripts </h3></div></div></div><p>
 If you are a programmer you will have guessed that you can edit the Scheme Script window to create any command you want. Even if you are not familiar with Scheme you may find that you can adapt other scripts to do what you want.
 </p><p>
 A good example of this is a script to insert a particular LilyPond directive into the score. This is all that many scripts do: it is easy to see the piece of LilyPond in the Scheme Script window, and by changing it you can create a new command.
 </p><p>
 For example, from the More menu select the command /menus/ObjectMenu/Instruments/Orchestral/RehearsalMark (the files are laid out in folders/directories in the same way as the menu system itself). Then choose Get Script from the right click menu. With this command its script is appended to the Scheme Script window. Here you can see the part that says
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
             (d-DirectivePut-standalone-postfix "RehearsalMark"  " \\mark \\default" )
</li></ul></div><p>
which is inserting the LilyPond directive "\mark \default" which inserts the default rehearsal mark. (The extra \s are needed to tell Scheme that you literally mean a \ sign). You can change this to insert any other LilyPond that you need - always doubling the \ signs. The you can save as a new menu item, or use Save Script to customize the script you started with.
 </p><p> 
 More ambitious programmers will need to know all the commands available. Besides the complete Denemo command set (the list is given in the Command Management window) there are the following additional Scheme procedures defined.
 </p></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>d-InitializeScript (parameter: action-name) runs a script init.scm in the menupath attached to the action whose name is given. Used by commands that need a time-consuming initialization step which can be skipped on subsequent calls.
</li><li>d-GetType returns a scheme string indicating the type of the current object
</li><li>d-GetNoteName returns  a scheme string, giving the note name a-g of the current note
</li><li>d-GetNote returns  a scheme string, the note name, accidental and octave of the current note (LilyPond notation)
</li><li>d-GetNotes returns  a scheme string, the notes of a chord separated by NULL characters
</li><li>d-PutNoteName takes a string argument, a note in LilyPond notation. Changes the note at the cursor. Not for use with multi-note chords.
</li><li>d-DiatonicShift Deprecated.
</li><li>d-NextObject moves cursor to next object, returning TRUE if current object has changed
</li><li>d-NextChord as next object, but skipping non-chord objects.
</li><li>d-NextNote Deprecated
</li><li>d-WarningDialog Pass a string argument to pop up a warning.
</li><li>d-GetOption (parameter string of options). Takes a null separated set of options and pops up a dialog offering them to the user. Returns the one chosen or #f if the user cancels.
</li><li>d-GetChar returns a string representing a keypress from the user (blocks waiting for a keypress)
</li><li>d-GetCommand returns a string containing the command name for the user's keypress (blocks waiting for a keypress)
</li><li>d-GetUserInput takes three strings, displays and returns the user's response as a string.
</li><li>
d-GetMidi
</li><li>
d-PutMidi
</li><li>
d-PlayMidiKey
</li><li>
d-BassFigure
  </li><li>
d-GetNoteAsMidi  
  </li><li>
d-RefreshDisplay
  </li><li>
d-InputFilterNames  sets the status bar
  </li><li>
d-Chordize Ensure that even a single note is treated as a chord - needed for some LilyPond constructs (e.g. fingerings)
  </li></ul></div><p>
  Standard Denemo commands that pop up dialogs will work as usual if no argument is passed to them from Scheme. In general if a string consisting of strings of the form "name=value\0" is passed these will be used and no popup will occur. The field "name" will be given the value "value". The \0 is a NULL character that separates the assignment strings. As a shorthand if there is only one value being passed you can just pass the value. The names of the fields depend on the action being called. So for example
</p><div class="example"><a name="schemecalls"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 2. </b></p>
(d-Open "filename=myfile.denemo\0")
</div><p>
will open the file "myfile.denemo".
  </p><p>
This feature is being rolled out, and currently works for

  These give attributes to objects that are not built-in but can be changed by the user.
  </p><p>
 Denemo Directives can be attached at almost every level of a Denemo score and can modify the behavior of the element concerned. They contain fields to describe how the element's properties should be modified, either in the display or in the printing. Elements, such as clefs notes etc have their own built-in display and print properties; Denemo Directives allow you (or scripts you invoke) to modify them for many more purposes than the built-in set allows. This means Denemo can grow - you can add features - without getting a new version.
  </p><p>
For example the drum clef is not built-in to Denemo. Instead a directive attached to the clef has a field (graphic) set to an image of the drum clef, and another field (postfix) set to the LilyPond syntax for a drum clef, while another field (override) is set to indicate that these values should replace the normal ones, rather than adding to them.
  </p><p>
The elements that can be modified in this way are the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
score: the LilyPond fields (prefix and postfix) are placed at the start of the score and just before each movement. The display field is shown at the top of the display.
</li><li>
scoreheader: Attached to the score. The postfix field is put inside a \header{} block at the start of the score.
</li><li>
movementcontrol: Attached to a movement. The prefix field is placed before the movements \score{} block, the postfix after it.
</li><li>
header: Attached to a movement. As scoreheader but for \header[] blocks inside the movement's score block.
</li><li>
paper: Attached to the score. The postfix is placed inside a \paper{} block.
</li><li>
layout: Attached to a movement. The postfix is placed inside a \layout{} block in the movement's scoreblock.
</li><li>
clef: Attached to a clef or clef change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the clef is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</li><li>
timesig: Attached to a time signature or time signature change. The graphic holds the displayed icon, gx,gy its position. The postfix field is put into the music at the point where the time signature is found, replacing the normal text if the override is set.
</li><li>
keysig: as timesig but for key signatures. (e.g. used to supress keysignatures in drum clef).
</li><li>
staff: The postfix field modifies the whole staff context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff
</li><li>
voice: The postfix field modifies the voice context, with the display field printed at the start of the staff containing the voice
</li><li>
standalone: A directive not attached to an music element - it comes with the music and is used for things like repeat bars etc.
</li><li>
chord: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the chord and the postfix after it.
</li><li>
note: The prefix field is emitted before the LilyPond for the note and the postfix after it. Examples are fingerings attached to notes etc. Again the display and graphic fields a placed in the display positioned relative to the note via the coordinate fields gx, gy (for the graphic) and tx, ty for the display text.
</li></ul></div><p>

  </p><p>
The Directives are sufficiently important to have their own commands.
  </p><p>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
d-DirectivePut-type-field where type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note  and field  is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. These commands take two arguments, a tag (string) and a value to set. For example
<div class="example"><a name="schemecalls"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3. </b></p>
 (d-DirectivePut-note-postfix "LHFinger" "3")
</div>
will put the fingering 3 on (after) the note at the cursor.
</li><li>
d-DirectiveGet-type-field type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note  and field  is one of display, tx, ty, gx, gy, graphic, prefix, postfix, override, midibytes. This function returns the value in the field or #f if there is no directive with the given tag at the cursor.
</li><li>
d-DirectiveDelete-type type is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note. This function returns #t or #f if a directive with the given tag was deleted.
</li></ul></div><p> 
  </p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773675"></a>The Directive Fields</h3></div></div></div>

 The fields of the Denemo Directive can control the Denemo Display and the LilyPond output.
  <p>
The fields in d-DirectiveGet/Put have the following meanings
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
postfix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (after the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</li><li>
prefix - A fragment of LilyPond to be output (before  the LilyPond for any object the directive is attached to). 
</li><li>
display - text to be shown in the Denemo Display
</li><li>
tx, ty - where to show the text in the Denemo Display
</li><li>
graphic - a .png image to be shown in the Denemo Display (the directory bitmaps holds these). The graphic can be saved for a command using the right-click -&gt; Save Graphic command, after selecting a portion of the print preview as the image required.
</li><li>
gx, gy - where to show thegraphic in the Denemo Display
</li><li>
minpixels - how much space to leave for this item in the Denemo Display
</li><li>
override - Contains bits to determine whether the LilyPond contained in the Directive (postfix and/or prefix fields) should override the normal LilyPond output, and whether the Graphic should replace the normal Denemo display for the item. A further tranche of bits controls MIDI output for the directive, which can override the normal MIDI interpretation of the music and provide additional information not explicit in the music notation (e.g. the tempo of an Adagio marking).
</li><li>
midibytes - a string of numbers (in hexadecimal format) whose interpretation is given by the MIDI bits in the override field
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
The override field contains the following bits:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_LILYPOND : override the LilyPond output normally used at this point, rather than adding to the normal output. The text used is in the prefix and postfix fields.
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_GRAPHIC : overrides what Denemo would normally show in the display with the image named in the graphic field of the directive
</li></ul></div><p>
The MIDI bits in the override field are as follows
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_VOLUME : the MIDI velocity to use
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_DURATION : affects the duration of a note. not yet implemented
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_REPEAT : indicates that an earlier passage should be repeated (from a directive of the same tag). not yet implemented
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_CHANNEL : midibytes field gives the MIDI channel to use (? implemented?)
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO : midibytes field gives the tempo to use.
</li></ul></div><p>
The interpretation of these flags is modified by the following flags:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_ONCE : the value in midibytes is to be used just for the item the directive is attached to. not yet implemented
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP : the value in midibytes is to be used from this point on
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RAMP : the value in midibytes is to be used as a starting value, a corresponding directive (i.e. with the same tag) gives the findal value, values are then interpolated between these.  not yet implemented
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE : value in midibytes  is used relative to the current value (otherwise it is an absolute value; e.g. an absolute velocity etc)
</li><li>
DENEMO_OVERRIDE_PERCENT : value in midibytes is interpreted as percentage value. not yet implemented
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
These flags are combined together to get the combination required for the directive using the scheme procedure called logior.</p><p>Here is an example, making a step-change in volume of 0x40 in the MIDI output, and printing "più mosso" in the output score </p><p></p><p>;;;;;;;;;; piu mosso</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-minpixels "StepTempo" 20)</p><p>(d-CursorLeft)</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-override "StepTempo" (logior DENEMO_OVERRIDE_TEMPO DENEMO_OVERRIDE_STEP DENEMO_OVERRIDE_RELATIVE))</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-midibytes "StepTempo" "40")</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-display "StepTempo" "piu mosso")</p><p>(d-DirectivePut-standalone-postfix "StepTempo" "^\\markup {\\bold \\italic \"più mosso\"}")</p><p>(d-RefreshDisplay)</p><p>In this example the directive is a standalone directive. MIDI commands are being extended to apply to chords and notes. Implementation of the commands for Voices, Movements, Score etc are not yet done.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id2773882"></a>Directive Edit Scripts</h2></div></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773888"></a>Introduction</h3></div></div></div><p>
    Score and movement directives can define a value for their graphic - a button then appears at the top of the score which can be used to edit the directive. Likewise Staff and Voice directives show as a properties icon before the staff to which they apply (staff directives above, voice directives below). Clicking on these lets you edit the directive.
  </p><p>
   The command EditDirective can be used when the cursor is on a Denemo Directive object, or an object with a Denemo Directive attached to it. What happens then is determined by a script named after the "tag", or name of the directive. For example the command RehearsalMark creates a Directive with tag "RehearsalMark" and EditDirective runs a script called RehearsalMark.scm.
  </p><p>
   There is also a low-level editing dialog which is invoked if no editing script exists or directly from scheme using (d-DirectiveTextEdit-* tagname). This allows you to edit and delete a directive directly. The other directive editing commands are EditScoreDirective EditMovementDirective EditStaffDirective EditVoiceDirective EditClefDirective EditKeysigDirective EditTimesigDirective for directives attached to the relevant objects.
  </p><p>
   The low level edit of directives from scheme uses the following command:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
 (d-DirectiveTextEdit-&lt;field&gt; &lt;tagname&gt;). Where &lt;tagname&gt; specifies the directive to be edited and &lt;field&gt; is one of score, scoreheader, movementcontrol, header, paper, layout, clef, timesig, keysig, staff, voice, standalone, chord or note.
</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
   For example     (d-DirectiveTextEdit-paper "PrintAllHeaders") gives low-level access to the directive setting the print all headers command in the paper block of the LilyPond output.
 </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2773953"></a>Edit Scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>
   Edit scripts are kept in a directory actions/editscripts parallel with the directory actions/menus where the commands themselves are kept. They have available functions to enable editing of directives which are defined in actions//denemo.scm executed at startup. The functions and variables for script editing are
  </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
d-GetOption followed by a nul separated list of options, offers the options to the user and returns one, or #f if the user cancels.
</li><li>
Extra-Offset tag type context. Takes three string options: tag is the name of the directive to be edited, which must be the name of a LilyPond object, type is the type of directive (note, chord, standalone, staff, voice or score), context is the LilyPond context of the object. Only tag is required. Shifts the object in the LilyPond output.
</li><li>
SetPadding tag type context. As Extra-Offset, it sets the space left around the item in the LilyPond engraving process.

From version 0.7.8 we have the ability to edit the LilyPond output within Denemo. This approach immediately makes Denemo able to do many more things (e.g. multiple verses for songs) with the music still editable from within Denemo. The gallery of examples and the standard templates contain examples which you can use.
  </p><p>
These can be used without knowing the LilyPond language (provided a suitable template or example file exists). Alternatively, with a general idea of how a LilyPond file works tweaks from the LilyPond documentation can be inserted into the LilyPond output and stored with the Denemo, leaving open the possibility of further editing of the notes within Denemo without the need to re-apply tweaks or keep separate LilyPond files.
  </p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2774042"></a>Using the LilyPond Window</h3></div></div></div><p>
Under the View menu is a Show LilyPond item which pops up a window with the LilyPond output in it. The text is interspersed with buttons which enable you to hide or show the various sections or to create custom versions. The text in bold can be altered and the alterations are kept in the Denemo file.
 </p><p>
The two windows are kept in sync, so you can move back and forth between editing textually and editing in Denemo.
   </p><p>
Right clicking on the text gives a menu for actions on the LilyPond text. There is one for moving the cursor to the LilyPond text for the current Denemo object. Moving the cursor in the text window with the arrow keys causes the Denemo window cursor to move in synchronism.
  </p><p>
This menu also includes a Print command that operates on the visible LilyPond text in the window.  This means you can open specific custom score blocks and print from them, or even make a temporary edit for just one print. If you save the program while a choice of custom scoreblocks is open then these are remembered. So when you reload and hit Print those score blocks will be printed.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id2774086"></a>Detail</h3></div></div></div><p>
Several custom scoreblocks can be kept, and by making the one(s) desired visible, the same Denemo file can be used to print a variety of things from the same music input. For example, a full score or a set of parts, or several voices on group of staffs or even a piano reduction. The custom scoreblocks can be are named using the comment on the first line (see the template Piano.denemo for an example).
  </p><p>
The various Voices/Staffs for the different Movements are separated by buttons. These are labelled by enumerating the movements and staffs in order, so the first voice in the first movement has the music defined as
"MvmntIVoiceIMusic" and so on. Within these music blocks you can insert arbitrary LilyPond text between notes, (the insertion points are marked by grey blocks)
and the text inserted will appear as a LilyPond directives in the main Denemo window. 
 </p><p>The main Denemo window also moves its cursor to correspond with where you are editing. (It should of course move the cursor immediately you click on a point in the music, but, as yet, it only moves the cursor when you press a key just before the note name - one of the arrow keys will do).
  </p><p>
Custom score blocks are created by right-clicking on the Standard score block and selecting create custom score block. You can cut and paste another score block, or start from the text of the standard one. If you print a single part from all movements, you get the standard scoreblock for this and can add it to your custom score block so that a single print command prints, e.g. both a full score and parts. Using the \book {} block you can put these into separate files (stored in the folder .denemo in your home folder).
</p><p>
The music defined by MvmntIVoiceIMusic is then used in the score blocks at the end of the LilyPond window, by the expression \MvmntIVoiceIMusic. This means that the same music can be output in several different ways, so that the same Denemo file can contain custom score blocks to output the music as a Piano Score with several voices or separate parts, for example.
  </p><p>
The definitions for MvmntIVoiceIMusic actually look like this
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
MvmntIVoiceIProlog = {\MvmntIVoiceITimeSig \MvmntIVoiceIKeySig \MvmntIVoiceIClef}
</li><li>

</li></ul></div><p>
Where \MvmntIVoiceI is the actual block of notes you have written, while the other definitions hold the time signature, clef etc. By using these, you can print the same music with different clefs, still maintaining the ability to edit the notes in Denemo.
  </p><p>Note that the normal Denemo Print commands are still operate as they do if you never look at the LilyPond window. What happens is that if you select the Print Current Part menu item then this creates a tailored standard scoreblock for that part. However, if you use the File-&gt;Print command then it prints the first custom scoreblock that is open (visible) (or the standard scoreblock if you do not have any custom scoreblocks).

Bugs:
Clicking (as opposed to using the arrow keys) in the LilyPond text does not move the cursor in the Denemo window.
Moving the text cursor in a lyric (etc.) does not move the Denemo cursor, so you cannot easily see where in the music it comes.
Inserting LilyPond text after last note of a movement has to be done in Denemo.
When you delete a LilyPond directive textually you have to move the cursor to start re-inserting it.
LilyPond notes cannot be parsed back in (would be useful for importing music from arbitrary LilyPond files).
LilyPond inserts at notes can only be completely deleted in the Denemo window - inserts are not merged.

We see a c major scale and an arpeggio spread over two octaves. Type the letter 'c', the cursor jumps to the nearest c, (if it is in the wrong octave, type a comma [to go down] , or an apostrophe [to go up]) .  We have reached middle c, we could start moving the cursor up note by note using the k key and then down note by note using the k key. A faster method however is to type the letter name of each note and  moves the cursor to the exact pitch. This holds true for the notes of a chord or arpeggio, we jump to the note by typing the note name and adjust the octave with the command and apostrophe. This works if within an octave. </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png"></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>Often you will want to enter notes that jump a large interval. To speed up note entry in such circumstances help Denemo determine the direction by moving one step in that direction using the left or right keys.

When you have inserted a LilyPond directive a green bar is printed at that point below the staff. In addition if you specify some display text it will be shown. If the LilyPond inserted is text to be printed above staff the notation ^text can be used. Denemo will show this text above the staff. Likewise, _text will cause text to be printed under the staff. If you wish to annotate your music use %text, which Denemo will print, but LilyPond will not (a newline character is automatically inserted for you to ensure this happens). LilyPond attached to chords or notes shows the display text only. The status bar also shows some of the information.
